## Executive Summary

Impressive aims to build the "Impress of Preventive Healthcare" — a vertically integrated network of owned-and-operated preventive health clinics combining advanced diagnostics, AI-powered interpretation, and a longitudinal digital health platform. The model targets health-conscious professionals (35+) seeking proactive rather than reactive healthcare.

### Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Rating | Summary |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Market Timing** | ★★★★★ | Exceptional — massive funding into preventive health, proven consumer demand |
| **Team-Founder Fit** | ★★★★★ | Exceptional — direct playbook transfer from Impress dental clinics |
| **Business Model** | ★★★★☆ | Strong — recurring membership, 41% gross margins, clear path to scale |
| **Competitive Position** | ★★★☆☆ | Moderate — well-funded competitors (Neko: $1.8B), but differentiated approach |
| **Fundability** | ★★★★☆ | Strong — thesis fits current VC appetite; team pedigree is compelling |

**Overall Verdict:** **STRONG OPPORTUNITY** — The combination of proven playbook, exceptional timing, and founder-market fit makes this one of the most compelling preventive healthcare opportunities in Europe. Key risk is capital intensity competing against Neko Health's $325M war chest.

| **Technical Capability** | ★★★★★ Full-stack healthcare platform (EMRs, AI treatment planning, scheduling) |
| **Domain Expertise** | ★★★★★ 5+ years running healthcare clinic tech at scale |
| **Scaling Experience** | ★★★★★ 0 → 100+ person org, managed through Series A/B/M&A |
| **Network** | ★★★★☆ Deep European healthtech network; access to Impress investors |

#### Cinzia — CRO & COO (Chief Revenue & Operating Officer)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Relevant Experience** | ★★★★☆ VC-backed founder ($1.2M raised), P&L management |
| **GTM Expertise** | ★★★★★ Scaled $46M Apple partnership at DJI; demand gen, founder-led sales |
| **Operating Capability** | ★★★★☆ General management, recruiting, finance, legal |
| **Domain Expertise** | ★★★☆☆ Personal stake (40s, aging parents) but no direct healthcare ops |
| **Network** | ★★★★☆ VC relationships (Speedinvest, Expa); enterprise BD experience |

### 3.2 Team Fit Scoring

| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Technical capability to build MVP | **5/5** | Yerezhan built Impress's entire clinic platform |
| Domain expertise in vertical | **5/5** | 5 years scaling healthcare clinics specifically |
| Customer access/network | **4/5** | Barcelona base, EU healthtech network, but not directly in preventive |
| Relevant past experience | **5/5** | Literal playbook transfer — same model, new vertical |
| Passion/commitment to problem | **5/5** | Personal stake (both 40s, aging parents who are doctors) |
| **Overall Team Fit** | **24/25** | Exceptional |

### 3.3 Unfair Advantages

1. **Playbook Transfer:** Yerezhan scaled the exact same model (vertically integrated clinics) at Impress. This is not theory — it's proven execution.

2. **Impress Validation:** Impress reached $79M revenue, 719 employees, $500-750M valuation. The playbook works.

3. **Healthcare Tech Stack:** Can likely reuse/adapt significant portions of Impress's EMR, scheduling, and patient platform architecture.

4. **Investor Access:** Team has relationships with major EU/US healthcare investors who backed Impress.

5. **Personal Conviction:** Both founders are in the target demographic (40s) with aging parents — they are building for themselves.

## 4. Business Model Analysis

### 4.1 Revenue Model

| Stream | Y1 Projection | % of Revenue | Notes |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Membership Revenue | €865,000 | 93% | 1,730 members × €500/year |
| Add-on Services | €51,900 | 6% | 20% uptake on extras |
| Referral Revenue | €8,650 | 1% | MRI commissions (10% referral) |
| **Total Revenue** | **€925,550** | 100% | |

### 4.2 Unit Economics (Per Patient)

| Metric | Value | Benchmark |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **ARPU (Annual)** | €500 | Forward: €1,788/yr ($149/mo), Neko: £299/scan |
| **COGS per Patient** | €315 | Blood: €85 + Cardio: €35 + Microbiome: €120 + Functional: €60 + Consumables: €15 |
| **Gross Profit per Patient** | €185 | |
| **Gross Margin** | **41%** | Good for healthcare; Neko likely 60%+ (less testing) |
| **Contribution Margin** | €185 | Healthy for subscription model |

### 4.3 Operating Model (Year 1, Single Clinic)

| Category | Amount | % of OPEX |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Personnel (8.5 FTE) | €478,000 | 64% |
| Facility Costs | €96,000 | 13% |
| Technology & Software | €56,400 | 8% |
| Marketing | €66,000 | 9% |
| Other Operating | €49,000 | 7% |
| **Total OPEX** | **€745,400** | 100% |

### 4.4 Path to Profitability

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Break-even Patients | 4,029 |
| Clinic Capacity | 4,680 patients/year (18/day) |
| Break-even Utilization | 86% |
| Y1 Target (SOM) | 1,730 patients (37% capacity) |
| Gap to Break-even | 2,299 patients |

**Analysis:** Single-clinic economics are challenging. At 37% utilization in Y1, the clinic loses €365K. This is a multi-clinic play where:
1. Fixed costs (tech platform, medical director) spread across clinics
2. Brand + referrals reduce CAC over time
3. 86% utilization is achievable (Neko has 100K+ waitlist)

### 4.5 Capital Requirements

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| CAPEX (Initial Investment) | €485,600 |
| Y1 Operating Loss | €364,800 |
| **Total Y1 Funding** | **€850,400** |

**For Multi-Clinic Expansion:**
- Assume 3-5 clinics for Series A scope
- Estimated need: €3-5M for first 3 clinics + platform + team

## 5. Risk Assessment

### 5.1 Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Competition from Neko** | High | High | Differentiate on depth vs. speed; target different segment |
| **Capital Intensity** | High | Certain | Prove unit economics in 1-2 clinics before scaling |
| **Regulatory Complexity** | Medium | Medium | Yerezhan has experience navigating EU health regs at Impress |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost** | Medium | Medium | Cinzia's GTM expertise; start with high-intent segment |
| **Medical Liability** | Medium | Low | Standard insurance; established protocols |
| **Execution Risk** | Low | Low | Team has done this exact playbook before |

### 5.2 Neko Competition Deep-Dive

**Neko's Advantages:**
- $325M raised, $1.8B valuation
- 100,000+ waitlist (proven demand)
- Proprietary hardware = defensible IP
- Capital-efficient model (scan stations vs. full clinics)
- Daniel Ek's celebrity founder status

**Why Impressive Can Still Win:**
1. **Market is huge** — $23B+ and growing; room for multiple winners
2. **Different value prop** — Neko is screening; Impressive is ongoing prevention
3. **Relationship model** — 80% of Neko customers rebook annually; Impressive membership creates stickier monthly/quarterly touchpoints
4. **Clinical depth** — 100+ biomarkers vs. Neko's more limited scan
5. **Geographic arbitrage** — Start in Spain/Southern Europe where Neko is not present

| Factor | Weight | Score | Weighted | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Market Size (TAM potential) | 20% | 5/5 | 1.0 | $46B by 2032, growing 10%+ |
| MVP Buildability | 15% | 5/5 | 0.75 | Team built this exact thing at Impress |
| Customer Acquisition Clarity | 20% | 4/5 | 0.8 | Target segment clear; CAC unproven |
| Market Momentum/Timing | 15% | 5/5 | 0.75 | Peak timing — Neko validation + funding wave |
| Team Fit | 20% | 5/5 | 1.0 | Exceptional — playbook transfer |

| **Total Score** | 100% | | **4.6/5** | |

### 6.2 Comparison to Impress (Yerezhan's Previous Company)

| Metric | Impress (Orthodontics) | Impressive (Preventive Health) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Funding Raised | €300M+ | Target: €3-5M Seed/A |
| Valuation | $500-750M | TBD |
| Clinics | 200+ | Start with 1-3 |
| Revenue | $79M | Y1 target: €925K/clinic |
| Employees | 719 | Start: 8-10 |
| Market | Clear aligners (competitive) | Preventive health (emerging) |
| Timing | 2020 (growth phase) | 2026 (early but validated) |

## 9. Recommendations

### 9.1 For Founders

1. **Prove Single-Clinic Economics First**
   - Get to 60%+ utilization before expanding
   - Validate CAC < €150 per member

2. **Differentiate Clearly from Neko**
   - Position as "ongoing health partner" vs. "annual screening"
   - Emphasize depth of diagnostics and longitudinal relationship

3. **Start in Southern Europe**
   - Avoid London/Stockholm where Neko dominates
   - Barcelona → Madrid → Lisbon → Milan

4. **Raise Sufficient Capital**
   - €3-5M Seed/Series A minimum
   - Don't under-capitalize against Neko's war chest

5. **Build the Platform Early**
   - Digital experience is the moat
   - Reuse/adapt Impress architecture

### 9.2 For Investors

**This is a compelling opportunity because:**
- Team has proven playbook execution at scale
- Market timing is exceptional (validated by Neko)
- Differentiated positioning (depth + relationship vs. speed)
- Capital-efficient path to proving thesis (single clinic)
- Clear path to €100M+ outcomes

**Key diligence questions:**
1. Detailed customer acquisition strategy and CAC assumptions
2. Competitive response if Neko enters Southern Europe
3. Reusability of Impress technology/IP
4. Medical director and clinical advisory recruitment

---

## 10. Conclusion

**Overall Assessment: STRONG OPPORTUNITY**

Impressive represents a rare combination of:
- Exceptional market timing (validated by $1.8B Neko)
- Exceptional team-founder fit (literal playbook transfer)
- Clear differentiation (depth + relationship vs. screening)
- Proven execution capability ($79M revenue at Impress)

The key risk is capital intensity competing against well-funded competitors, but the team's experience, geographic strategy, and differentiated positioning create a credible path to venture-scale outcomes.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to detailed business planning and investor outreach.
