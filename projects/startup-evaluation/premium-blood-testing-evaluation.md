# Premium Blood Testing Business Evaluation

**Evaluation Framework:** Paul Graham / YC Methodology
**Date:** January 2026
**Companies Analyzed:** Superpower, Tryholo, Function Health, Thriva, Lucis

---

## Executive Summary

| Criterion | Score | Verdict |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Founder Desire | 2/5 | Weak - No personal pain point for this team |
| Founder Capability | 4/5 | Good - Could build, but not unique advantage |
| Non-Obvious Value | 2/5 | Low - Crowded, well-funded competitors |
| Depth of Demand | 3/5 | Moderate - Niche audience, public healthcare alternative |
| Expansion Potential | 3/5 | Moderate - Geographic expansion possible |
| Moat Potential | 2/5 | Weak - Commodity service, brand differentiation only |
| **Overall** | **2.7/5** | **Not recommended for this team** |

**Bottom Line:** The premium blood testing space is crowded with well-funded competitors ($51M+ at Superpower, $17M at Thriva), and the value proposition in Europe is weakened by free public healthcare. The user's instinct that this "sounds like snake oil" reflects a real market skepticism that makes customer acquisition expensive. **This is not a good opportunity for this team.**

## The User's Skepticism: Is It Snake Oil?

### The Valid Concerns

**1. Public Healthcare Offers Free Blood Tests**

In Spain (and most of Europe):
- Annual checkup blood work is free through public system
- GP can order comprehensive panels if medically indicated
- Wait times exist but aren't prohibitive for preventive care

**Counter-argument from the industry:**
- Public healthcare tests ~10-15 markers (CBC, lipid panel, glucose, liver/kidney)
- Premium services test 100+ including hormones, inflammation markers, vitamins
- "You don't know what you don't test for"

**Reality check:** Most people don't need 100+ biomarkers. The marginal value of testing homocysteine, testosterone, and obscure inflammation markers is questionable for healthy individuals.

**2. The "Optimization" Narrative**

The pitch: "Optimize your biology for peak performance"

The skepticism:
- Normal ranges exist for a reason
- "Optimizing" testosterone or cortisol without symptoms is medically dubious
- Many recommendations are lifestyle changes anyone could do
- Creates anxiety about normal variation

**3. Actionability Gap**

Even with 100 data points:
- Most insights are "eat better, sleep more, exercise"
- Truly abnormal findings require medical follow-up anyway
- The AI "insights" are often generic

### Where It's NOT Snake Oil

**1. Specific populations with genuine needs:**
- People with chronic conditions needing frequent monitoring
- Athletes with performance optimization goals
- Individuals with family history of specific diseases
- Those with diagnosed deficiencies tracking supplementation

**2. Legitimate convenience value:**
- Time-pressed professionals who can't wait 3 weeks for NHS appointment
- Privacy-conscious individuals
- Expats without established healthcare relationships

**3. The "peace of mind" market:**
- Some people genuinely value data and tracking
- Willingness to pay for certainty is real

## YC Framework Evaluation

### 1. Founder Desire (2/5)

**Do Yerezhan and Cinzia genuinely want this product?**

| Question | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Would they use it themselves? | Unclear - Neither mentioned blood testing as a pain point |
| Solving their own problem? | No - Cinzia's concern is stroke prevention, not biomarker tracking |
| Personal urgency? | No - Both have access to healthcare through existing channels |

**Evidence against:**
- Team brief mentions: longitudinal imaging, stroke prevention, elderly care
- Blood testing was NOT in original areas of interest
- No personal story driving this (unlike grandma story for CareMatch)

**Verdict:** This is a "made up" idea for this team - noticed because others raised money, not because of organic insight.

### 2. Founder Capability (4/5)

**Can the team build this?**

| Question | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Can build v1 without hiring? | Yes - Yerezhan can build the platform |
| Relevant domain expertise? | Moderate - Healthcare tech, but not consumer wellness |
| Iterate quickly? | Yes - Standard SaaS product |

**The gap:**
- Team's strength is B2B clinic software, not B2C consumer apps
- No lab partnership experience
- No direct consumer health brand experience

**Verdict:** Could build it, but no unique advantage over well-funded competitors.

### 3. Non-Obvious Value (2/5)

**Do few others recognize this opportunity?**

| Question | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Few others see this? | No - $100M+ already invested in this space |
| Why hasn't it been done well? | It HAS been - Superpower, Function Health, Thriva |
| Founder's unique insight? | None apparent |

**Competitive Reality:**

| Competitor | Funding | Gap for New Entrant |
|------------|---------|---------------------|
| Superpower | $51M | First-mover in US, strong brand |
| Function Health | Well-funded (Bryan Johnson) | Most comprehensive (blood + MRI) |
| Thriva | $17.1M | UK market leader |
| Lucis | $8.5M (General Catalyst) | European expansion play |
| Tryholo | Seed | Spain-first, local advantage |

**The insight gap:**
- No differentiated technology
- No unique customer access
- No regulatory moat
- No cost advantage

**Verdict:** This is a crowded space with well-funded players. A new entrant would need significant differentiation.

### 4. Depth of Demand (3/5)

**Is there intense need from a specific group?**

| Question | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Intense need from specific group? | Partial - Biohackers, quantified selfers |
| Would users be devastated if this disappeared? | No - Would switch to alternatives |
| Are people hacking together workarounds? | Yes - Some order through private labs directly |

**The demand profile:**

| Segment | Demand Depth | Size |
|---------|--------------|------|
| Biohackers/quantified self | High | Small (~1-2% of population) |
| Health-anxious affluent | Medium | Medium |
| Chronic condition managers | High | Medium, but often covered by insurance |
| General population | Low | Large, but won't pay premium |

**The European challenge:**
- "Why pay €200 when NHS is free?" is a real objection
- Conversion requires overcoming this mental model
- CAC likely very high

**Verdict:** Demand exists but is narrower in Europe than US due to public healthcare.

### 5. Expansion Potential (3/5)

**Path Out of the Well**

| Path | Viability |
|------|-----------|
| Geographic expansion | Moderate - Can expand across Europe |
| Vertical expansion | Possible - Add imaging, genetics |
| Platform play | Possible - Become infrastructure for other wellness companies |

**The Function Health model:**
- Started with blood testing
- Acquired Ezra (full-body MRI)
- Now offers comprehensive preventive package
- This is the logical expansion

**Verdict:** Expansion possible but requires significant capital to compete with Function Health's head start.

### 6. Moat Potential (2/5)

**Why Won't Big Companies Copy This?**

| Barrier | Strength |
|---------|----------|
| Technology | Weak - No proprietary tech |
| Network effects | None - Not a marketplace |
| Brand | Moderate - Trust matters in health |
| Regulatory | Weak - No special approvals needed |
| Switching costs | Weak - Data portability required by GDPR |

**The uncomfortable truth:**
- This is fundamentally a logistics + brand business
- The blood test itself is a commodity
- The app/insights layer is easily replicable
- Differentiation comes from brand, not technology

**Verdict:** Weak moat. Competing on brand against well-funded players is expensive.

## Final Assessment: Not Recommended

### Why This Is Wrong for This Team

1. **No organic founder desire** - Blood testing wasn't mentioned in their areas of interest
2. **Crowded market** - $100M+ already invested, no gap for new entrant
3. **Wrong team strengths** - B2B clinic software expertise, not B2C wellness apps
4. **European headwinds** - Public healthcare makes value prop harder
5. **Capital intensive** - Need to outspend Superpower/Function Health on brand
6. **Weak moat** - No technology or network effect differentiation

### The User's Instinct Was Right

> "It is true that the digital experience is basically non-existent... somehow it sounds a little bit like snake oil to me"

This captures the core problem:
1. The "digital experience" improvement is real but not 10x better
2. The health value is often marginal for healthy individuals
3. Differentiation is brand-based, not technology-based

## Differentiated Ideas With Higher Potential

If the team wants to be in preventive health but not compete directly with blood testing players, here are higher-potential opportunities:

### Idea 1: LongitudinalView (Already Evaluated - TOP PICK)

**Why it's better than blood testing:**
- No well-funded competitor doing multi-organ longitudinal comparison
- Team's Impress experience directly applies (DICOM, PACS, multi-clinic)
- B2B model matches team's strengths
- Higher barriers to entry (regulatory, integration complexity)

**Team Fit Score:** 24/25

### Idea 2: Clinic-Side Preventive Care Platform

**Concept:** B2B software for private clinics to offer comprehensive preventive care packages (blood + imaging + follow-up) as a premium service.

**Why it's differentiated:**
- Sell to clinics, not consumers (B2B, team's strength)
- Clinics handle patient acquisition, compliance, billing
- Software enables the service, doesn't compete with it
- Build on existing clinic relationships from Impress network

**Business Model:**
- €500/clinic/month platform fee
- €20/patient preventive assessment generated
- White-label reports with clinic branding

**Why it's better:**
- Leverages team's B2B healthcare expertise
- Doesn't require building consumer brand
- Clinics have existing patient relationships
- Higher margins than consumer plays

**Team Fit Score:** 22/25

### Idea 3: Employer Wellness Infrastructure

**Concept:** B2B platform enabling companies to offer preventive health benefits without managing the complexity themselves.

**Why it's differentiated:**
- Not competing with Superpower for consumers
- Companies want to offer wellness benefits but lack infrastructure
- SaaS model with predictable revenue
- Can aggregate demand across employers for better lab pricing

**Business Model:**
- €5-15/employee/month
- Companies pass cost to employees or subsidize
- Network of labs and clinics for fulfillment

**Why it's better:**
- B2B motion matches team's GTM experience
- HR buyers, not consumer acquisition
- Recurring revenue from employer contracts
- Higher LTV than individual consumers

**Team Fit Score:** 20/25

### Idea 4: Preventive Health Data Layer

**Concept:** Infrastructure/API for any company building preventive health products. Handle lab integrations, data normalization, compliance.

**Why it's differentiated:**
- "Stripe for preventive health data"
- Enable others to build, don't compete with them
- Regulatory compliance as a service
- Multi-country from day one (European advantage)

**Business Model:**
- Usage-based API pricing
- €0.50-2 per test result processed
- Enterprise contracts for larger customers

**Why it's better:**
- Infrastructure plays have stronger moats
- Not dependent on consumer brand building
- Can serve multiple verticals (employer wellness, clinic software, insurers)
- Yerezhan's integration experience directly applies

**Team Fit Score:** 20/25

### Idea 5: Imaging + Blood Integration Platform

**Concept:** The Function Health model, but B2B. Help clinics offer integrated preventive packages combining imaging and blood work with unified reporting.

**Why it's differentiated:**
- Function Health is B2C and US-focused
- European clinics want to compete with this
- Team can enable them with software

**Business Model:**
- Platform subscription for clinics
- Per-assessment fee for integrated reports
- White-label patient app

**Why it's better:**
- Builds on LongitudinalView concept
- Adds blood integration (addresses the question about differentiation)
- Still B2B (team's strength)
- Clinics handle patient acquisition

**Team Fit Score:** 23/25

---

## Recommendation

**Don't build a Superpower/Tryholo competitor.** The market is crowded, well-funded, and misaligned with the team's strengths.

**Instead, pursue one of these in order of recommendation:**

1. **LongitudinalView** (4.45/5) - Already evaluated, highest team fit
2. **Imaging + Blood Integration Platform** (Idea 5) - Combines preventive focus with B2B model
3. **Clinic-Side Preventive Care Platform** (Idea 2) - Pure B2B play in preventive space

All three leverage:
- Yerezhan's healthcare platform experience
- Cinzia's B2B sales capabilities
- Existing clinic network from Impress
- Barcelona/European market position

None require:
- Building a consumer brand from scratch
- Competing with $50M+ funded players
- Convincing Europeans to pay for something public healthcare offers free
