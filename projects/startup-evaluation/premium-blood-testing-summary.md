# Premium Blood Testing: Evaluation Summary

**Date:** January 2026
**Companies Analyzed:** Superpower, Tryholo, Function Health, Thriva, Lucis
**Verdict:** Not Recommended for This Team

---

## Overall Score: 2.7/5

| Criterion | Score | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Founder Desire | 2/5 | Blood testing wasn't in your areas of interest - this is a "noticed because funded" idea, not organic |
| Founder Capability | 4/5 | Could build, but no unique advantage over well-funded competitors |
| Non-Obvious Value | 2/5 | Crowded market with $100M+ invested, no differentiation possible |
| Depth of Demand | 3/5 | Niche audience; public healthcare weakens value prop in Europe |
| Expansion Potential | 3/5 | Geographic expansion possible but capital-intensive |
| Moat Potential | 2/5 | Commodity service + brand battle = expensive to win |

## Why Your Instinct Was Right

> "It sounds a little bit like snake oil to me"

This captures the core problem:

1. **The "digital experience" improvement is real but not 10x better**
2. **The health value is often marginal for healthy individuals**
3. **Differentiation is brand-based, not technology-based**

### The European Headwind

In Spain (and most of Europe):
- Annual checkup blood work is **free** through public system
- "Why pay €200?" is a constant objection
- Premium services test 100+ markers vs 10-15, but most people don't need them
- CAC is very high when competing against "free"

### The Competitive Reality

| Competitor | Funding | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Superpower (US) | $51M | First-mover, strong brand |
| Function Health (US) | Well-funded | Most comprehensive (blood + MRI) |
| Thriva (UK) | $17.1M | UK market leader |
| Lucis (France) | $8.5M | European expansion play |
| Tryholo (Spain) | Seed | Local advantage in Spain |

**No gap for a new entrant without significant differentiation.**

## Why This Is Wrong for This Team

1. **No organic founder desire** - Blood testing wasn't mentioned in areas of interest
2. **Crowded market** - $100M+ already invested, no gap for new entrant
3. **Wrong team strengths** - B2B clinic software expertise, not B2C wellness apps
4. **European headwinds** - Public healthcare makes value prop harder
5. **Capital intensive** - Need to outspend Superpower/Function Health on brand
6. **Weak moat** - No technology or network effect differentiation

## 5 Differentiated Ideas (Higher Potential)

If you want to be in preventive health but not compete directly with blood testing players:

### Idea 1: LongitudinalView (Already Evaluated - TOP PICK)

**Team Fit Score: 24/25**

AI-powered longitudinal imaging comparison for preventive care clinics.

**Why it's better than blood testing:**
- No well-funded competitor doing multi-organ longitudinal comparison
- Team's Impress experience directly applies (DICOM, PACS, multi-clinic)
- B2B model matches team's strengths
- Higher barriers to entry (regulatory, integration complexity)

---

### Idea 2: Clinic-Side Preventive Care Platform

**Team Fit Score: 22/25**

B2B software for private clinics to offer comprehensive preventive care packages (blood + imaging + follow-up) as a premium service.

**Why it's differentiated:**
- Sell to clinics, not consumers (B2B, team's strength)
- Clinics handle patient acquisition, compliance, billing
- Software enables the service, doesn't compete with it
- Build on existing clinic relationships from Impress network

**Business Model:**
- €500/clinic/month platform fee
- €20/patient preventive assessment generated
- White-label reports with clinic branding

---

### Idea 3: Employer Wellness Infrastructure

**Team Fit Score: 20/25**

B2B platform enabling companies to offer preventive health benefits without managing the complexity themselves.

**Why it's differentiated:**
- Not competing with Superpower for consumers
- Companies want to offer wellness benefits but lack infrastructure
- SaaS model with predictable revenue
- Can aggregate demand across employers for better lab pricing

**Business Model:**
- €5-15/employee/month
- Companies pass cost to employees or subsidize
- Network of labs and clinics for fulfillment

---

### Idea 4: Preventive Health Data Layer

**Team Fit Score: 20/25**

Infrastructure/API for any company building preventive health products. Handle lab integrations, data normalization, compliance.

**Why it's differentiated:**
- "Stripe for preventive health data"
- Enable others to build, don't compete with them
- Regulatory compliance as a service
- Multi-country from day one (European advantage)

**Business Model:**
- Usage-based API pricing
- €0.50-2 per test result processed
- Enterprise contracts for larger customers

---

### Idea 5: Imaging + Blood Integration Platform

**Team Fit Score: 23/25**

The Function Health model, but B2B. Help clinics offer integrated preventive packages combining imaging and blood work with unified reporting.

**Why it's differentiated:**
- Function Health is B2C and US-focused
- European clinics want to compete with this
- Team can enable them with software

**Business Model:**
- Platform subscription for clinics
- Per-assessment fee for integrated reports
- White-label patient app

---

## Recommendation

**Don't build a Superpower/Tryholo competitor.**

**Instead, pursue one of these in order of recommendation:**

| Rank | Idea | Score | Why |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| 1 | **LongitudinalView** | 4.45/5 | Highest team fit, validated by GE/icometrix, no direct competitor |
| 2 | **Imaging + Blood Integration Platform** | 23/25 | Combines preventive focus with B2B model |
| 3 | **Clinic-Side Preventive Care Platform** | 22/25 | Pure B2B play in preventive space |

All three leverage:
- Yerezhan's healthcare platform experience
- Cinzia's B2B sales capabilities
- Existing clinic network from Impress
- Barcelona/European market position

None require:
- Building a consumer brand from scratch
- Competing with $50M+ funded players
- Convincing Europeans to pay for something public healthcare offers free
