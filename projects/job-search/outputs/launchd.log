The CSV structure follows a **unified entry model** pattern—both job postings and proactive targets share the same schema, differentiated by `entry_type`. This design enables filtering/sorting across both categories while maintaining consistent fields for outreach tracking. The `gtm_signal` field acts as a categorical indicator that helps prioritize outreach timing.
