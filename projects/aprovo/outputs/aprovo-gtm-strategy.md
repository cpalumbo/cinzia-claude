# Aprovo GTM Strategy
**Go-To-Market Analysis for Cofounder Review**

---

## Executive Summary

Aprovo is a **conversion platform** for dental clinics in Spain—not another patient messaging tool. The core loop: WhatsApp nudge → treatment quote review → e-signature → payment → PMS write-back. The North Star is **€ uplift in accepted presupuestos within 30-60 days**.

**Beachhead segment**: Independent dental clinics with 3-15 chairs and ≥40% insured patients in Spain, currently losing revenue on unsigned treatment quotes.

---

## 1. Market Decision

### Beachhead Segment Rationale

| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Winnable in 18 months** | ✅ Spain-first, 10 pilot clinics achievable |
| **High pain (painkiller)** | ✅ Revenue leakage is measurable and urgent |
| **Willingness to pay** | ✅ ROI-based (% of recovered revenue) |
| **Growth potential** | ✅ 20,000+ dental clinics in Spain; DSO expansion path |

### Competitive Landscape

**Alternatives**: Generic PRM tools (Doctoralia, dental CRMs), manual WhatsApp, phone follow-ups.

**Our edge**: End-to-end conversion (WA + e-sign + pay + write-back) vs. messaging-only tools. Competitors don't close the loop.

---

## 2. Early Customer Profile (ECP)

### Primary Buyer
**Clinic Owner / Practice Manager** at independent dental clinics (3-15 chairs)

- **Behavior**: Already uses WhatsApp informally; open to tech but skeptical of "another tool"
- **Pain**: Sees €10K-50K/month in unsigned quotes; staff wastes hours on follow-up calls
- **Trigger**: End of quarter revenue review; staff complaints about admin burden

### Validation Status

| Assumption | Validation Method | Status |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Clinics lose significant € on unsigned quotes | Pilot data | 🟡 In progress |
| Staff time is wasted on manual follow-ups | Customer interviews | ✅ Confirmed |
| WhatsApp is preferred patient channel | Usage data | ✅ Confirmed |
| Clinics will pay €199-699/mo for ROI tool | Pilot pricing | 🟡 Testing |

---

## 3. Value Proposition

### Value Proposition Canvas

**Customer Jobs**
- Convert more treatment quotes to revenue
- Reduce admin time on patient follow-ups
- Get visibility into conversion funnel

**Pains**
- Revenue leakage from unsigned presupuestos
- Staff time on phone tag and re-typing statuses
- No single view of quote-to-payment performance

**Gains**
- Immediate € uplift (target: 15-25%)
- Minutes saved on follow-ups
- Mobile payments accepted faster

### One-Liner
> "Convert more treatment quotes to revenue—via WhatsApp, e-signature, and payment—in minutes, not days."

---

## 4. Pricing Strategy

### Hypothesis (Skimming + Value-Based)

| Tier | Target | Price | Includes |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Starter** | Independents (1-3 chairs) | €199/mo + usage | WA + e-sign + basic dashboard |
| **Growth** | Multi-chair (4-15) | €399/mo + usage | + PMS write-back + analytics |
| **DSO** | Groups (15+ chairs) | €699/site/mo | + onboarding + portal ops |

### Pricing Principles
- **Not competing on price**—competing on ROI. If we deliver 15%+ € uplift, €399/mo is trivial.
- **Usage-based component** (WA messages, e-signatures) aligns cost with value.
- **Revise every 3-6 months** based on pilot data.

---

## 5. Positioning

### Positioning Statement
> For **independent dental clinics in Spain** who **lose revenue on unsigned treatment quotes**, Aprovo is a **WhatsApp-native conversion platform** that **closes the loop from quote to payment**. Unlike generic patient messaging tools, Aprovo **integrates e-signature, payment, and PMS write-back**—so you see ROI, not just messages sent.

### Key Differentiators (USPs)
1. **End-to-end conversion**: WA + e-sign + pay + write-back in one thread
2. **ROI dashboard**: See € uplift, not vanity metrics
3. **Spain-first compliance**: eIDAS signatures, GDPR, approved WA templates

### What We Are NOT
- Not a CRM
- Not a generic messaging tool
- Not a patient acquisition platform

---

## 6. Growth Channels

### Channel Selection (Phase 1: Pilot)

| Channel | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Outbound** | 🔴 Primary | Target clinics with visible quote backlogs; personalized demos |
| **Partners** | 🟡 Secondary | PMS vendors (Gesden, Clinic Cloud) as referral sources |
| **Community** | 🟢 Tertiary | Dental association events, local meetups |

### Outbound Playbook
1. Build list: 500 clinics in Barcelona/Madrid with 3-15 chairs, ≥40% insured
2. Personalize: Reference their PMS, patient volume, insurer mix
3. Offer: Free 4-week pilot with ROI measurement
4. Convert: €399/mo after proving 15%+ uplift

### Growth Loop (Post-PMF)
**Distribution loop**: Clinic shares payment link → Patient sees Aprovo branding → Patient mentions to their dentist → New clinic lead

---

## 7. Execution Plan

### Pilot Objectives (4-6 weeks)
- Sign **10 paid pilots** (clinics with ≥40% insured share)
- Run acceptance loop: WA → e-sign → card/SEPA → PMS write-back
- **Success metric**: ≥15-25% € uplift at 6+ sites

### Key Experiments

| Experiment | Hypothesis | Metric | Timeline |
|------------|------------|--------|----------|
| WA template A/B | Benefit-focused > generic | Open rate, accept rate | Week 1-2 |
| Pricing tier test | €399 vs €299 | Conversion, churn | Week 2-4 |
| PMS write-back value | Write-back increases retention | NPS, renewal | Week 4-6 |

### Team Needs
- **Product**: Owner with execution power (founder)
- **Sales**: Outbound specialist for clinic outreach
- **Ops**: PMS integration support

### North Star Metric
**€ uplift in accepted presupuestos within 30-60 days**

Supporting metrics: % financed cases, no-show reduction, minutes saved, mobile payment adoption

---

## 8. Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| "Looks like generic PRM" | Lead with conversion KPI; show PMS screenshots of accepted/signed/paid |
| PMS integration friction | Start with export/Zapier; secure partner terms; prioritize 2-3 adapters |
| WhatsApp policy/consent | Template governance; explicit opt-in; audit logs |
| Slow clinic sales cycles | Offer free pilot; prove ROI before asking for commitment |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize pilot list**: 50 target clinics in Barcelona (lead scraping done)
2. **Outreach sequence**: Personalized emails + LinkedIn + WA
3. **Pilot onboarding**: Streamline setup to <2 hours
4. **Weekly GTM sync**: Review funnel metrics, adjust messaging
