## Updated Outreach Talking Points

### For Multi-Location Clinics (13 clinics):
"Managing quote follow-up across [X] locations is complex. Each location generates [Y] quotes/month, but there's no centralized system to ensure every patient gets consistent follow-up. Aprovo solves this—one dashboard for all [X] clinics, automated WhatsApp/email sequences, and you'll see conversion rates improve by 25% within 90 days."

### For 10+ Location Chains (3 clinics):
"At [X] locations, you're generating 500+ quotes monthly. Even if your conversion rate is industry-leading at 30%, that's still 350 patients not moving forward = €1.2M+ in lost annual revenue. Aprovo's centralized platform ensures no quote falls through the cracks across your entire network."

### For Regional Chains (5-9 locations):
"With [X] clinics in the Barcelona area, you need a centralized follow-up system. Right now, each location likely manages quotes differently. Aprovo standardizes this—same messaging, same timing, better results. Regional chains like yours typically see 20-30% conversion improvements."

## ROI Calculator (Example: Dentisalut - 8 locations)

**Current State**:
- 8 locations × 20 quotes/month = 160 quotes/month
- Current conversion: 25% = 40 patients
- Lost quotes: 120 patients × €3,500 = €420K/month lost

**With Aprovo** (+25% improvement):
- New conversion: 31.25% = 50 patients
- Additional conversions: 10 patients/month
- Additional revenue: 10 × €3,500 = €35K/month = €420K/year

**Aprovo Cost** (estimated):
- €500-1,000/month per location = €4K-8K/month for 8 locations
- Annual cost: €48K-96K

**Net ROI**: €420K - €96K = **€324K net annual benefit** (4.4x ROI)

## Data Quality Note

**Location Counting Methodology**:
- Scraped clinic websites for "locations", "clínicas", "centros", "sedes" pages
- Counted unique addresses, phone numbers, Google Maps embeds
- Cross-referenced with location headers and structured data

**High Confidence** (12/15 clinics): Found dedicated locations pages
**Medium Confidence** (2/15): Counted based on addresses on homepage
**Low Confidence** (1/15): Defaulted to 1 location (unable to verify)

**Recommended**: Manually verify location counts for top 5 targets during discovery calls.
