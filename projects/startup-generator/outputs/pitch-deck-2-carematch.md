# CareMatch
## The B2B Platform Connecting Families with Trusted Caregivers

---

## The Problem

**Finding a trustworthy caregiver for your aging parent is one of life's most stressful decisions.**

### The Caregiver Crisis

When an elderly person needs home care, families face:

1. **Discovery Problem**
   - Where do you even start looking?
   - Word of mouth is unreliable
   - Agencies have waitlists, high fees, and variable quality

2. **Trust Problem**
   - How do you vet someone who will be alone with your parent?
   - Background checks are expensive and complex
   - References are hard to verify

3. **Monitoring Problem**
   - Once a caregiver is in the home, how do you know things are going well?
   - Your grandma fell at night and broke her femur. Nobody heard her.
   - Abuse and neglect go undetected for months

4. **Continuity Problem**
   - Caregivers leave, get sick, or become unavailable
   - Starting the search over is exhausting
   - No system maintains care quality through transitions

### The Scope

- **Europe Home Care Market:** €123.4 billion (2024)
- **Spain Elderly Care Services:** €7.89 billion → €11.89 billion by 2030
- **90% of seniors** prefer to age at home (AARP)
- **89% of providers** have denied care due to workforce shortages

- Validates massive demand for coordinated home care
- But Qida is capital-intensive (employs caregivers directly)

### 2. Spain's Demographics Are Accelerating
- By 2040, Spain will have the world's longest life expectancy
- 26% of population will be 65+ by 2037
- 12% of European elderly care market

### 3. Technology Enables New Solutions
- Sensi.AI raised $31M for audio-based home monitoring
- Inspiren raised $35M for AI senior living technology
- The infrastructure for smart monitoring is mature

### 4. Workforce Crisis Demands Efficiency
- Not enough caregivers to meet demand
