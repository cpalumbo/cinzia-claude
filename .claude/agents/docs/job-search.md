# Job Research: Executive Roles in AI, Tech & Deep Tech

This research is designed to identify roles where my experience is a fit (reference @.claude/agents/docs/my-CV.md) and also companies where my experience could be valuable and I should consider a spontaneous application, even if there are no roles published yet. For the latter, the goal is to enable early, proactive outreach to founders, CEOs, and boards when AND before relevant roles are formalized. For the former, the goal is surface roles systematically as they are published so I can reach out to recruiters proactively and timely, in addition to placing formal applications.

Search across THREE tracks: \

**TRACK 1: Startup Partnerships at Tech Giants** \
Search companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, AWS, Microsoft, Meta, NVIDIA careers for: \
Head of Startup Partnerships, Startup Partnerships Lead, Director Startup Partnerships, \
Head of Startup Programs, Startup Ecosystem Lead, Developer Partnerships, Strategic Partnerships (startups). \

**TRACK 2: Ex-Founder / Former Founder Roles in promising startups and scaleups** \
Search LinkedIn, Indeed, YCombinator, Wellfound, Greenhouse job boards for: \
'ex-founder', 'former founder', 'ex founder', 'founding experience', \
'Business Founder', 'Ex-Founder GTM', 'Ex-Founder Sales', 'Ex-Founder Ops'. \
Focus on AI, SaaS, deep tech, robotics, developer tools companies. \

**TRACK 3: GTM Leadership at Startups and Scaleups** \
Search for: Head of GTM, Head of Go to Market, GTM Lead, VP GTM, Head of Growth, International Expansion, \
Head of Strategic Partnerships, Head of Business Development, VP Partnerships, \
COO, CCO, CRO, General Manager roles \
in robotics, AI, and deep tech startups (Seed to Series C). \
For these companies, also capture company-level GTM transition signals (hiring sales/marketing teams, expansion announcements). \

**Location filter:** Barcelona, London, Remote (with international scope), or EU-based. \
**Time window:** roles posted in last 30 days; company signals in last 90 days. \

For each result capture this in a CSV file (each result below should be a column) and save to /.claude/projects/job-search/outputs/jobs_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).csv : \
company_name, company_description, industry_vertical, job_title, job_url, location, \
date_posted, fit_score (1-5) given my CV, company_stage, GTM_maturity_signal, outreach_angle \
Call the first column "type" and put "job_posting" if there's a specific role or "proactive_target" where there's positive GTM signal but no specific role published yet) \

## Track 2: Ex-Founder / Former Founder Roles

### Why This Track Matters
A growing number of startups are explicitly hiring "ex-founders" or "former founders" as a distinct job category. These roles value the unique skillset founders bring: ownership mentality, comfort with ambiguity, customer obsession, and ability to build from scratch.

### Why This Fits Your Profile
- VC-backed founder experience (Speedinvest, Expa) → exactly what these roles seek
- Scaled from 0 → proven ability to build in ambiguous environments
- Technical + commercial hybrid → can bridge product and GTM
- Hands-on operator → not a career corporate person
- Startup ecosystem native → understand the founder journey

### Types of Ex-Founder Roles that are fitting

**1. Ex-Founder GTM / Sales / Ops**
- Focus: Sales, operations, go-to-market, owning revenue end-to-end
- Example: Soff - "Ex-Founder Turned Sales, Ops & GTM Pro"
- Comp: $80K-$200K + 0.5-1% equity
- Best for: Founders who led commercial functions

**2. Enterprise Sales Lead (Ex-founder)**
- Focus: Own strategic customer relationships, build sales engine
- Example: Kaedim (London) - "Great fit for an ex-founder or early builder who enjoys working closely with customers"
- Best for: Founders with B2B/enterprise experience

### Common Requirements in Ex-Founder Job Descriptions
```
- "Scaled from 0 to X amount in ARR" or "built and scaled a SaaS or AI-driven product"
- "Ex-founder or founding team member"
- "Technical fluency" (even for non-technical roles)

## Prepare Outreach Angles

Prepare some angles for my manual outreach depending on job description and type of company:

### For Startup Partnerships Roles (Tech Giants)
1. **Founder who gets founders:** "Built a VC-backed startup (Speedinvest, Expa) — I know the founder journey, the pain points, and what startups actually need from platforms"
2. **Startup ecosystem native:** "Deep network across EU/US startup ecosystem — VCs, accelerators, founders — built through years of operating and fundraising"
3. **DevTools DNA:** "Built developer-facing products and communities; understand how startups adopt and scale with APIs and platforms"
4. **Platform partnerships at scale:** "Managed $46M/year Apple partnership at DJI — know how to structure, negotiate, and grow strategic platform relationships"
5. **Hands-on operator:** "Not a career BD person — I've built products, hired teams, raised capital, and shipped. Startups trust operators."

### For GTM Roles (Startups)
1. **DJI + Apple:** "Managed $46M/year strategic partnership with Apple at DJI during hypergrowth"
2. **Founder credibility:** "Recently wrapped up a VC-backed startup (Speedinvest, Expa) — understand the founder journey"
