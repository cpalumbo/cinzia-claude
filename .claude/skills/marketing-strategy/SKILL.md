# Marketing Strategy for Startups

This skill helps startups create focused, actionable marketing strategies by combining classic strategic frameworks with practical channel prioritization.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Strategic Foundation** → Define 4Ps (Product, Price, Place, Promotion)
2. **Channel Scoring** → Score 17 traction channels, select top 3
3. **Idea Generation** → Brainstorm tactics aligned with chosen channels
4. **Action Plan** → Create prioritized marketing roadmap

## Step 1: Strategic Foundation (Kotler's 4Ps)

Before diving into tactics, establish strategic clarity:

| Element | Key Questions |
|---------|---------------|
| **Product** | What problem does it solve? What's the unique value prop? Who's the ideal customer? |
| **Price** | What pricing model? How does it compare to alternatives? What's the perceived value? |
| **Place** | Where do customers discover/buy? What's the distribution strategy? |
| **Promotion** | What message resonates? Which channels reach the audience? |

For detailed 4Ps analysis framework, see [references/kotler-4ps.md](references/kotler-4ps.md).

## Step 2: Traction Channel Scoring

Startups have limited marketing bandwidth. Score all 17 channels, then focus on top 3.

### The 17 Traction Channels

1. Sales (cold outreach)
2. BD/Partnerships
3. SEM & Display Ads
4. SEO/AEO
5. Existing Platforms
6. Trade Shows
7. Speaking Engagements
8. Email Marketing
9. KOLs/Influencers
10. Social Media
11. Content Marketing
12. Engineering as Marketing
13. Community Building
14. Public Relations/Media
15. Viral Marketing
16. Affiliate Programs
17. Unconventional Publicity

### Scoring Framework

Score each channel 1-5 on these dimensions:

| Dimension | 1 (Poor) | 5 (Excellent) |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Potential** | Low ceiling | Massive scale possible |
| **Cost** | Very expensive | Nearly free |
| **Reach** | Exact target market difficult | Reaches exact target market |
| **Time to Test** | Months to validate | Days to validate |

**Score = Potential × Cost × Reach × Time to Test**

Focus on channels scoring **≥200** (your "Core 3").

For scoring template and examples, see [references/traction-channels.md](references/traction-channels.md).

## Step 3: Marketing Idea Generation

After selecting core channels, brainstorm specific tactics. Match ideas to:
- Your core 3 channels
- Your 4Ps positioning
- Your resource constraints

For 140+ categorized marketing ideas, see [references/marketing-ideas.md](references/marketing-ideas.md).

## Step 4: Create the Action Plan

Structure output as:

```
# [Company] Marketing Strategy

## Strategic Positioning
- Product: [value prop summary]
- Price: [model + positioning]
- Place: [distribution channels]
- Promotion: [key message]

## Core Channels (Top 3)
1. [Channel] - Score: X - Why: [rationale]
