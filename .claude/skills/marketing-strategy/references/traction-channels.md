# Traction Channels Scoring Framework

Based on Gabriel Weinberg's "Traction" framework, adapted for early-stage startups.

## The Core Principle

**Startups die from spreading too thin.** Score all 17 channels, ruthlessly focus on top 3.

## Scoring Dimensions

### Potential (1-5)
How big could this channel get?

| Score | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | <100 customers possible | Niche forum with 500 members |
| 2 | 100-1K customers possible | Regional trade show |
| 3 | 1K-10K customers possible | Industry publication |
| 4 | 10K-100K customers possible | Popular podcast in vertical |
| 5 | 100K+ customers possible | Google Ads, LinkedIn |

### Cost (1-5)
Note: **5 = lowest cost** (counterintuitive but makes math work)

| Score | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | >$100 per lead | Trade show booth |
| 2 | $50-100 per lead | Premium conferences |
| 3 | $20-50 per lead | Paid ads (competitive market) |
| 4 | $5-20 per lead | Content + SEO |
| 5 | <$5 per lead | Viral, organic social |

### Reach (1-5)
Does this channel reach your exact target customer?

| Score | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Mostly irrelevant audience | General news site for B2B SaaS |
| 2 | Some overlap with target | LinkedIn (broad) |
| 3 | Good overlap | Industry conference |
| 4 | Strong overlap | Vertical-specific community |
| 5 | Bulls-eye targeting | Intent signals + outreach |

### Time to Test (1-5)
How quickly can you validate if this works?

| Score | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | 6+ months | SEO, community building |
| 2 | 3-6 months | Content marketing, PR |
| 3 | 1-3 months | Partnerships |
| 4 | 2-4 weeks | Email campaigns, events |
| 5 | <2 weeks | Paid ads, cold outreach |

## Quarterly Re-Scoring

Channels evolve. Re-score every quarter:
- Did CAC change?
- Did we max out a channel?
- Did market conditions shift?
- Did we build new capabilities?

Channels that scored low initially may become viable as you scale.
