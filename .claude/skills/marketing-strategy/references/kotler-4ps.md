# Kotler's 4Ps Framework for Startups

Deep-dive analysis framework for each marketing mix element.

## Product Analysis

### Core Questions
- What specific problem does this solve?
- What's the "10x better" factor vs alternatives?
- What are the must-have vs nice-to-have features?
- What's the product vision in 1 year? 3 years?

### Startup-Specific Considerations
- **MVP scope**: What's the minimum feature set to validate demand?
- **Differentiation**: Technical moat? UX advantage? Data network effects?
- **Customer segment**: Who's the "hair on fire" customer who needs this NOW?

### Output Template
```
Product Summary:
- Problem: [specific pain point]
- Solution: [how product addresses it]
- Key differentiator: [why us over alternatives]
- Target segment: [specific customer profile]
- Success criteria: [what makes a user successful]
```

## Price Analysis

### Pricing Models
| Model | Best For | Startup Consideration |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Freemium | PLG, high volume | Conversion % is key metric |
| Subscription | SaaS, recurring value | Focus on expansion revenue |
| Usage-based | Variable consumption | Align price with value delivered |
| One-time | Clear deliverables | Requires constant new acquisition |
| Hybrid | Complex products | Start simple, add complexity later |

### Core Questions
- What's the customer's willingness to pay?
- What do alternatives cost? (including "do nothing")
- What's the LTV:CAC you need for sustainability?
- Does price communicate quality/positioning?

### Pricing Strategy Matrix
| | Low Price | High Price |
|--|-----------|------------|
| **Low Value** | Volume play | Avoid |
| **High Value** | Penetration/Land & Expand | Premium positioning |

### Output Template
```
Pricing Summary:
- Model: [pricing structure]
- Price point: [amount and basis]
- Positioning: [premium/mid-market/budget]
- Comparison: [vs key alternatives]
- LTV target: [expected customer lifetime value]
```

## Place (Distribution) Analysis

### Distribution Channels
| Channel | Characteristics | Best When |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Direct (website) | Full control, higher margin | Strong brand or SEO |
| Marketplaces | Built-in traffic, lower margin | Discovery is a problem |
| Partners/Resellers | Leverage existing relationships | Complex sales, trust matters |
| App stores | Massive reach, platform dependency | Mobile-first products |
| Sales team | High touch, expensive | High ACV, complex products |

### Core Questions
- Where do customers currently buy similar products?
- What's the customer's buying journey?
- What friction exists in current distribution?
- What partnerships could accelerate reach?

### Output Template
```
Distribution Summary:
- Primary channel: [how most customers will find/buy]
- Secondary channels: [additional distribution]
- Customer journey: [awareness → consideration → purchase]
- Key partners: [strategic distribution partnerships]
```

## Promotion (Communication) Analysis

### Message Framework
| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Headline** | What do you do in 5 words? | "Email scheduling made simple" |
| **Subhead** | For whom and why? | "For busy founders who need..." |
| **Proof** | Why believe you? | "Trusted by 500+ YC companies" |
| **CTA** | What action to take? | "Start free trial" |

### Positioning Statement Template
```
For [target customer]
Who [has this problem]
[Product name] is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [alternatives]
We [key differentiator]
```

### Channel-Message Fit
Different channels require different message approaches:

| Channel | Message Style | Length |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Ads | Direct benefit, clear CTA | Very short |
| Content | Educational, value-first | Long form |
| Social | Personality, engagement | Medium |
| Email | Personalized, direct | Medium |
| PR | Newsworthy angle | Story format |

### Output Template
```
Promotion Summary:
- Positioning: [one-line positioning statement]
- Key message: [primary value proposition]
- Proof points: [credibility builders]
- Tone: [brand voice/personality]
- Primary channels: [where we'll communicate]
```

## 4Ps Alignment Check

After completing analysis, verify alignment:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Product ↔ Price | Does price reflect product value? |
| Product ↔ Place | Is product available where customers look? |
| Product ↔ Promotion | Does message accurately reflect product? |
| Price ↔ Place | Is pricing appropriate for the channel? |
| Price ↔ Promotion | Does messaging justify the price? |
| Place ↔ Promotion | Are we promoting in the right places? |

Red flags to watch:
- Premium price with mass-market distribution
- Complex product with self-serve only
- B2B enterprise messaging in consumer channels
- Low price with high-touch sales approach
