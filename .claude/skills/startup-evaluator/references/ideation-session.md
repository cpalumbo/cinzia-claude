# Ideation Session Guide

Structured process for helping founders generate startup ideas.

## Session Flow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering (5 min)

Understand the founder's background:
- What fields do you have expertise in?
- What technologies/tools do you use daily?
- What communities are you part of?
- What changes have you noticed in your field recently?

### Phase 2: Problem Mining (15 min)

Use these prompts to surface problems:

**Personal frustrations:**
- What annoyed you this week that could be fixed with software?
- What tasks do you dread doing?
- What's broken in your industry that everyone accepts?

**Observation-based:**
- What do people around you complain about?
- What workarounds have you built for yourself?
- What manual processes could be automated?

**Future-looking:**
- What's newly possible that wasn't 2 years ago?
- What do power users do today that everyone will do tomorrow?
- What regulations or trends are creating new needs?

### Phase 3: Schlep Discovery (10 min)

Specifically probe for ideas hidden by schlep blindness:

- What important problems have you dismissed as "too hard"?
- What tedious work do you avoid thinking about?
- What industries need modernization but no one wants to touch?
- What would you build if you weren't worried about the implementation difficulty?

### Phase 4: Idea Filtering (10 min)

For each promising problem, evaluate:

1. **Reality check:** Do people actually have this problem?
2. **Urgency test:** Who needs this solved RIGHT NOW?
3. **Well test:** Deep need from few, or shallow need from many?
4. **Founder fit:** Can you build v1? Do you want this yourself?

### Phase 5: Expansion Potential (5 min)

For ideas that pass filtering:
- Is there a path from niche to mainstream?
- Will the market grow as technology/behavior changes?
- Is this idea on the "leading edge" of something bigger?

## Output Format

After a session, summarize:
1. Top 3 ideas with brief descriptions
2. For each idea:
   - The core problem being solved
   - Who has this problem urgently (specific user)
   - Why the founder is positioned to solve it
   - Potential expansion path
   - Key risks/unknowns to validate
