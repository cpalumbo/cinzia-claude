description: Go-To-Market Strategy framework for reaching Product-Market Fit. Use when helping users develop GTM strategies, make market entry decisions, define early customer profiles, validate product-market fit, set pricing, create positioning/messaging, select growth channels, or build GTM execution systems. Based on the methodology from "GTM Strategist" by Maja Voje, this skill covers the 6 key GTM decisions (Market, ECP, Product, Pricing, Positioning, Growth) plus execution frameworks.

# GTM Strategist

A comprehensive framework for developing Go-To-Market strategies to reach Product-Market Fit (PMF).

## Core GTM Philosophy

GTM is a 3-18 month journey requiring special ops mindset: simple plans, good intelligence, play on strengths, speed, purpose, and security. Over 95% of innovations fail—winning requires laser focus on one Beachhead Segment at a time.

## The 6 GTM Decisions Framework

Every GTM strategy requires confident decisions in these interconnected areas:

### 1. MARKET — Choose Your Terrain
**Beachhead Strategy**: Win one segment before expanding.

Criteria for selecting your Beachhead Segment:
- Winnable in 18 months or less
- High pain point (painkiller, not vitamin)
- Adequate willingness to pay
- Market healthy enough for future growth

**Key Frameworks**:
- **Market-Problem Map**: Score segments by Pain Level, Ease of Sale, Ease of Implementation
- **Segment Ranking Table**: Compare 3-5 segments systematically
- **2x2 Positioning Matrix**: Visualize competitive gaps
- **SWOT Analysis**: Identify strategic directions

See `references/market-frameworks.md` for detailed templates.

### 2. EARLY CUSTOMER PROFILE (ECP) — Know Your Buyer
Research-driven customer archetypes, not fictional personas.

**OODA Loop Process**:
1. **Observe**: Validate the problem exists
2. **Orient**: Test if solution resonates
3. **Decide**: Formulate hypothesis, continue validation
4. **Act**: Develop winning GTM based on findings

**Key Frameworks**:
- **Assumption Map**: Plot assumptions on Known/Unknown vs Important/Unimportant
- **ECP Validation Toolkit**: Customer interviews, surveys, usability tests, pilot sales

See `references/ecp-frameworks.md` for research methods.

### 3. PRODUCT — Build and Validate PMF
The holy grail: customers who love your product and keep coming back.

**Value Proposition Canvas**:
- Customer Jobs, Pains, Gains
- Products/Services, Pain Relievers, Gain Creators

**PMF Signals**:
| Stage | Poor PMF | Good PMF |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Acquisition | Slow, expensive | Cost-efficient, WOM |
| Activation | Users don't "get it" | Users excited, ask to prepay |
| Retention | Losing nearly everyone | Curves flatten |
| Monetization | Burning money | CAC < LTV |
| Referral | Weak/non-existent | Strong, users bring users |

**Measuring PMF**:
- Retention curves (must flatten)
- PMF Survey: "How would you feel if you could no longer use [Product]?" → 40%+ "Very disappointed" = PMF signal
- NPS and referral metrics

See `references/product-frameworks.md` for analytics setup.

### 4. PRICING — Capture Value
Price is the currency of value exchange. 72% of innovation fails due to pricing/monetization flaws.

**Four Pricing Inputs**:
1. **Added Value**: What are they paying for? (Find your value metric)
2. **WTP**: How much will they pay? (Van Westendorp, Gabor-Granger)
3. **Competition**: What do alternatives cost?
4. **Your Position**: What do you need to charge?

**Pricing Strategies**:
- **Penetration**: Lower price to optimize adoption
- **Skimming**: Higher price to capture more value from early adopters
- **Competitive**: Within 20-30% of alternatives

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Setting prices too cheap (destroys perceived quality)
- One price fits all (different segments have different WTP)
- Giving away too much for free
- Waiting too long to monetize
- "Set it and forget it" (revise every 3-6 months)

See `references/pricing-frameworks.md` for WTP research methods.

### 5. POSITIONING — Control the Narrative
What makes your solution different AND better for your target market.

**Positioning Steps** (by Andrej Peršolja):
1. Define target audience (ECP)
2. Identify alternatives and market gaps
3. List your assets (features, team capabilities)
4. Turn assets into benefits ("So what?" 5x)
5. Build USP (unique + valued by customer)
6. Merge into story (UVP + USPs)
7. Test position (landing page A/B tests)
8. Make practical for team (checklists)

**Messaging Principles**:
- Clear and concise (max 3 key points, ideally 1)
- Speaks to specific needs, desires, pain points
- Authentic tone of voice
- Uses storytelling and emotion
- Backed by social proof

**Branding Essentials**:
- Brand strategy (purpose, values, personality)
- Brand guidelines (visual identity, tone)
- Brand expression (how it comes to life)

See `references/positioning-frameworks.md` for templates.

### 6. GROWTH — Reach Your Market
Select channels relevant to your audience and fuel with Growth Loops.

**7 GTM Growth Channels**:
1. **Inbound**: Content → leads (SEO, ebooks, tools)
2. **Paid Digital**: SEM, social ads, influencers, PR, affiliates
3. **Outbound**: Cold email/calls to targeted prospects
4. **ABM**: Personalized campaigns for high-value accounts
5. **Community**: Value creation in communities
6. **Partners**: Joint marketing/sales with complementary companies
7. **PLG**: Product delivers value before monetization

**Channel Selection Criteria**:
- Customer research (where do they go?)
- Competitor research (what works for them?)
- Your resources and strengths
- Unit economics (CAC < LTV within your timeline)
- Untapped opportunities

**Demand Strategy**:
- **Demand Capture**: Solution-aware customers actively searching
- **Demand Generation**: Meet prospects earlier, educate market

**5 Growth Loop Archetypes**:
1. Usage-Based (Loom: record → share → others see)
2. User-Generated Content (Google: content created → indexed → found)
3. Collaboration (Figma: share file → collaborator onboards)
4. Viral (Spotify Wrapped: emotional content → shared)
5. Distribution (Calendly: share link → exposure → new users)

See `references/growth-frameworks.md` for channel selection guides.

## GTM Execution System

### Goal Setting
- **North Star Metric (NSM)**: Single metric measuring value delivered (leads to revenue, reflects customer value, measures progress)
- **OKRs**: Quarterly objectives with 3-5 measurable key results

### GTM Canvas
One-page summary covering:
- Mission/Vision/NSM
- Market (TAM, SAM, SOM)
- ECP description
- Value Proposition
- Pricing strategy
- Positioning statement
- Growth channels
- Timeline and milestones

### Execution Essentials

**Timeline**: Define clear lifeline (3-18 months) with milestones

**Team** (jobs to be done):
- Product management with execution power
- Product marketing
- Sales enablement
- Data analyst
- Channel experts

**Organization**:
- Single source of truth (metrics dashboard)
- One project management tool
- One communication channel
- Documentation/knowledge base
- Weekly GTM meetings (45-60 min)
- Monthly retrospectives

**Tools** (lean stack):
- Analytics: GA, Amplitude, Mixpanel
- Project management: Jira, Trello, Asana
- Communication: Slack, Teams
- Testing: VWO, Optimizely

**Budget Categories**:
- Labor (30-70%)
- Marketing/Sales/Growth
- Technology/Tools
- Contingency (10%)

### Experimentation Loop

**Inception Stage** (initial proof):
- Observations, expert advice, competitor research
- Customer interviews, surveys
- Market and data analysis

**Experimentation Stage** (stronger evidence):
1. Hypothesis creation
2. Setup and launch
3. Data collection and analysis
4. Insight mapping
5. Implement or iterate

**Prioritization**: Impact vs Ease matrix for selecting experiments

## Workflow: Creating a GTM Strategy

When helping with GTM strategy, follow this sequence:

1. **Clarify Objectives**: What does success look like? What's the timeline?
2. **Assess Market**: Analyze market size, trends, competition
3. **Define Segments**: Use Market-Problem Map to identify best beachhead
4. **Profile ECP**: Research-based customer archetype with validation plan
5. **Articulate Value**: UVP that addresses ECP's core problem
6. **Set Pricing**: WTP-informed pricing strategy
7. **Craft Positioning**: Differentiated message with USPs
8. **Select Channels**: 2-3 channels matched to ECP and resources
9. **Build System**: Team, tools, budget, timeline
10. **Plan Experiments**: Prioritized tests to validate assumptions

## Key Metrics to Track

| Stage | Metrics |
|-------|---------|
| Awareness | Reach, impressions, brand searches |
| Acquisition | CAC, conversion rate, sign-ups |
| Activation | Time to value, onboarding completion |
| Retention | Churn, retention curves, DAU/MAU |
| Revenue | LTV, ARPU, MRR/ARR |
| Referral | NPS, K-factor, referral rate |
