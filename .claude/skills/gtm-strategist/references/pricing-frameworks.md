# Pricing Frameworks

## The Four Pricing Inputs

### 1. Added Value: What Are They Paying For?
Find your **value metric**—the unit of value exchange.

**Good Value Metric Criteria**:
- Easy for user to understand
- Aligns with value received
- Grows with usage

**Examples**:
| Product | Value Metric |
|---------|--------------|
| Loom | Minutes recorded |
| Slack | Messages sent |
| Stripe | Revenue processed |
| Mailchimp | Subscribers |
| Zoom | Meeting participants |

### 2. WTP: How Much Will They Pay?
Research willingness to pay before setting prices.

### 3. Competition: How Much Are They Currently Paying?
- Direct competitor pricing
- Alternative solution costs
- Cost of doing nothing

### 4. Your Position: What Do You Need Them to Pay?
- Unit economics requirements
- Positioning (premium vs. accessible)
- Growth vs. profitability goals

## WTP Research Methods

### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

Ask four questions:
1. At what price would it be **too cheap** (quality concerns)?
2. At what price is it a **bargain** (great deal)?
3. At what price is it **getting expensive** (have to think)?
4. At what price is it **too expensive** (wouldn't buy)?

Plot responses to find:
- **Optimal Price Point (OPP)**: Where "too cheap" = "too expensive"
- **Indifference Price Point (IDP)**: Where "bargain" = "expensive"
- **Acceptable Price Range**: Between OPP and IDP

### Gabor-Granger Method

Direct price testing:
1. Show product at Price A
2. "Would you buy at this price?" (Yes/No)
3. If Yes → show higher price
4. If No → show lower price
5. Continue until you find threshold

Plot demand curve: price vs. % who would buy

### Interview-Based WTP

Ask progressively:
1. "What would you expect this to cost?"
2. "What would be a fair price for the value you'd receive?"
3. "At what price would you definitely buy?"
4. "At what price would you hesitate?"
5. "At what price would you definitely not buy?"

## Pricing Strategies

### Penetration Pricing
**Goal**: Maximize adoption/market share
**When**: Network effects, high competition, need critical mass
**Risk**: Hard to raise prices later

### Price Skimming
**Goal**: Maximize profit from early adopters
**When**: Innovative product, limited competition, price-insensitive buyers
**Risk**: Slower adoption, invites competition

### Competitive Pricing
**Goal**: Match market expectations
**When**: Commoditized market, similar products
**Range**: Stay within 20-30% of alternatives

## Pricing Models

### Fixed/Flat Rate
- Simple to understand
- Predictable revenue
- May leave money on table from heavy users

### Usage-Based
- Aligns with value delivered
- Scales with customer
- Revenue less predictable

### Per-Seat/Per-User
- Common in B2B SaaS
- Easy to calculate
- Can discourage adoption

### Tiered/Packages
- Good-Better-Best options
- Captures different segments
- Anchoring effects

### Freemium
- Free tier + paid upgrades
- Lowers barrier to adoption
- Must convert meaningful % to paid

### Hybrid
Combine models (e.g., base fee + usage)

## Pricing Packages: Bundling

### McDonald's Menu Analogy
- **Leaders**: Main product (Big Mac)—why they came
- **Fillers**: Complementary items (fries, drink)
- **Killers**: Items that kill the bundle if included (coffee)

### Good-Better-Best Structure
| Element | Good | Better | Best |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| Price | $ | $$ | $$$ |
| Features | Core only | Core + Popular | Everything |
| Target | Price-sensitive | Mainstream | Power users |
| Purpose | Entry point | Main revenue | Upsell |

### Anchoring & Decoy Effects
- High-priced option makes middle seem reasonable
- Decoy package makes target package look better
- "Most Popular" badge guides choice

## Psychological Pricing Tactics

### Price Endings
- $9.99 vs $10.00 (charm pricing)
- $297 vs $300 (fewer syllables)
- Fewer digits = perceived lower price

### Framing
- Monthly vs. annual (show smaller number)
- "Per day" framing ($1/day vs $30/month)
- Show savings explicitly

### Display
- Remove currency symbols where possible
- Left-align discounted prices
- Larger font for lower/sale prices

### Color
- Red prices work for men
- Women respond better to black/red, not blue
- Test for your audience

## Common Pricing Mistakes

1. **Too cheap**: Destroys perceived quality, unsustainable economics
2. **One price fits all**: Different segments have different WTP
3. **Too much free**: No incentive to convert
4. **Late monetization**: Users expect free forever
5. **Set and forget**: Market changes, value increases—revisit quarterly

---

## Pricing Experiments

### When to Experiment
- New product launch
- New feature release
- New market/segment
- Every 3-6 months minimum

### What to Test
- Price points (10-20% increments)
- Packaging/tiers
- Value metric changes
- Free trial length
- Annual vs monthly discounts
- Add-ons and upsells

### Testing Methods
- A/B test pricing pages
- Cohort analysis
- Pilot pricing in new markets
- Survey before changing
- Grandfather existing customers

### Price Increase Communication
1. Remind of value delivered (show their data)
2. Explain what's changing
3. Explain why (continued improvement)
4. Set clear effective date (30-60 days notice)
5. Offer grace period or lock-in option
6. Provide opt-out path

## Pricing Impact

From Paddle research (500+ SaaS companies):
- 1% improvement in monetization = **12-16% revenue increase**
- 4x more impactful than 1% improvement in acquisition

From Madhavan Ramanujam:
- **72% of innovation fails** due to pricing/monetization/business model flaws
