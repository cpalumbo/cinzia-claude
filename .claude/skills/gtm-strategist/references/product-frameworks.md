# Product Frameworks

## Value Proposition Canvas

### Customer Profile (Right Side)
**Customer Jobs**
- Functional: Tasks they're trying to complete
- Social: How they want to be perceived
- Emotional: How they want to feel

**Pains**
- Undesired outcomes
- Obstacles
- Risks
- Frustrations with current solutions

**Gains**
- Required outcomes (must-haves)
- Expected outcomes (should-haves)
- Desired outcomes (nice-to-haves)
- Unexpected outcomes (delighters)

### Value Map (Left Side)
**Products & Services**
- Core product
- Supporting services
- Features

**Pain Relievers**
- How you eliminate/reduce pains
- Specific solutions to specific pains

**Gain Creators**
- How you produce gains
- Outcomes your product enables

### Fit
Draw connections between Pain Relievers → Pains and Gain Creators → Gains.
Strong fit = multiple connections to high-priority jobs/pains/gains.

## Unique Value Proposition (UVP) Formula

**Template**:
"For [target customer] who [has this problem], [product name] is a [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], we [key differentiator]."

**Example**:
"For busy startup founders who struggle to manage investor relationships, DealFlow Pro is a CRM that automates fundraising communication. Unlike generic CRMs, we're purpose-built for the fundraising workflow with built-in investor intelligence."

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

### Purpose
Test core value hypothesis with minimal investment.

### MVP Types (by confidence level)

**Low Confidence** (Problem validation):
- Landing page with signup
- Explainer video
- Customer interviews
- Smoke tests (fake door tests)

**Medium Confidence** (Solution validation):
- Wizard of Oz MVP (manual behind the scenes)
- Concierge MVP (high-touch delivery)
- Prototype/mockup testing
- Single-feature MVP

**High Confidence** (Scale validation):
- Full MVP with core features
- Beta program
- Paid pilot

### MVP Success Criteria
- Define specific metrics before building
- Set pass/fail thresholds
- Time-box the experiment
- Plan next steps for both outcomes

## Product-Market Fit (PMF)

### Definition
"Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market." — Marc Andreessen

### PMF Signals by Stage

| Stage | Poor PMF | Good PMF |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Acquisition | Slow, expensive, hard to spark interest | Cost-efficient, viral, WOM flourishes |
| Activation | Users don't "get it," slow to progress | Users excited, ask to pay/get access early |
| Retention | Losing nearly everyone | Curves flatten, net positive users |
| Monetization | Burning money, hesitant to convert | Profitable unit economics (CAC < LTV) |
| Referral | Weak/non-existent, low satisfaction | Strong, users bring new users |

### Time to PMF (Examples)
- ChatGPT: Immediate (5 days to 1M users)
- Dropbox: Quick
- Netflix: 18 months
- Segment: 1.5 years
- Airbnb: 2 years
- Superhuman: 3 years
- Amplitude: 4 years

## Measuring PMF

### Method 1: Retention Curves
Plot % of users retained over time (daily/weekly/monthly cohorts).

**Good sign**: Curve flattens (some users stick)
**Bad sign**: Curve approaches zero (everyone churns)

### Method 2: Sean Ellis PMF Survey

Send to users who have experienced core value.

**Key question**: "How would you feel if you could no longer use [Product]?"
- Very disappointed
- Somewhat disappointed
- Not disappointed
- N/A - I no longer use it

**Benchmark**: 40%+ "Very disappointed" = strong PMF signal

**Full survey questions**:
1. How did you discover [Product]?
2. How would you feel if you could no longer use [Product]?
3. What would you likely use as an alternative?
4. What is the primary benefit you've received?
5. Have you recommended [Product] to anyone?
6. What type of person would benefit most?
7. How can we improve?
8. Can we follow up?

### Method 3: NPS (Net Promoter Score)
"How likely are you to recommend [Product] to a friend or colleague?" (0-10)

- **Promoters** (9-10): Loyal enthusiasts
- **Passives** (7-8): Satisfied but not enthusiastic
- **Detractors** (0-6): Unhappy customers

**NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors**

## Analytics System Setup

### Key Metrics by Stage

**Awareness**:
- Reach, impressions
- Brand searches
- Share of voice

**Acquisition**:
- Traffic by source
- CAC by channel
- Conversion rate (visitor → signup)

**Activation**:
- Time to value (TTV)
- Onboarding completion rate
- Feature adoption rate

**Retention**:
- Churn rate
- Retention cohorts
- DAU/WAU/MAU
- Session frequency

**Revenue**:
- LTV
- ARPU/ARPA
- MRR/ARR
- Expansion revenue

**Referral**:
- NPS
- K-factor
- Referral rate

### Analytics Tool Selection

**Session-based** (anonymous behavior):
- Google Analytics
- Plausible
- Hotjar (heatmaps)

**User-based** (individual journeys):
- Amplitude
- Mixpanel
- PostHog

**Dashboards**:
- Looker Studio
- Metabase
- Power BI

### Event Tracking Plan
Document key events before implementation:
- Event name
- When triggered
- Properties captured
- Which metrics it feeds

## Four Fits Beyond PMF

PMF alone isn't enough. Consider:

1. **Product/Market Fit**: Does the product solve the market's problem?
2. **Product/Channel Fit**: Are you delivering through the right channels?
3. **Channel/Model Fit**: Is the channel sustainable for your business model?
4. **Model/Market Fit**: Will the market pay what your model requires?

### Example: Slack vs. Discord vs. Teams
Same "job" (team communication), but:
- Different target segments
- Different channels
- Different business models
- Different positioning

All successful because of alignment across all four fits.
