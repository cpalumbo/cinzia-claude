# Positioning Frameworks

## What Is Positioning?

Positioning = making sure your target customers understand what you do and why it's relevant to them in a way that differentiates you from competitors.

**Key insight**: Positioning happens whether you control it or not. Customers will form opinions. Better to guide that perception intentionally.

## Symptoms of Bad Positioning

- Not attracting enough leads
- Attracting mixed audiences
- Prospects don't want to pay your prices
- Poor conversion rates
- Poor product engagement
- Long sales cycles
- Prospects don't understand what you do

## Positioning Process (Peršolja Framework)

### Step 1: Define Target Audience
Your ECP—who specifically are you positioning for?

### Step 2: Identify Alternatives and Market Gap
- Who are the competitors?
- What are alternative solutions?
- Where are unmet needs?

### Step 3: List Your Assets
Everything you have to work with:
- Product features
- Team expertise
- Technology
- Partnerships
- Data
- Network

### Step 4: Turn Assets into Benefits
Use "So what?" test (ask 5 times):

**Asset**: Small team
→ So what? Quick to respond
→ So what? Fast support
→ **Benefit**: Get help immediately when you're stuck

**Asset**: AI integration
→ So what? Automates follow-up timing
→ So what? Don't have to remember
→ **Benefit**: Never miss a follow-up again

### Step 5: Build USP
Filter benefits by two criteria:
1. **Valued by customer** (they care about this)
2. **Unique to you** (competitors don't have it)

What remains = your Unique Selling Proposition(s)

### Step 6: Merge into Story
Combine:
- **UVP** (your main promise)
- **USPs** (why you're the best choice)

### Step 7: Test Position
- Create landing page variations
- A/B test messaging
- Run ads to drive traffic
- Measure conversion rates
- Aim for 50+ conversions per variant

### Step 8: Make Practical
Create checklists for team:
- Does this post talk about [key benefit]?
- Does it speak to [target audience]?
- Does it support our positioning?

## UVP Template

**Basic**: "For [target] who [need], [product] is a [category] that [key benefit]."

**With differentiation**: "Unlike [alternatives], we [key differentiator]."

**Example**:
"The only CRM that keeps your small team accountable. Our AI suggests ideal follow-up times so you never lose a deal."

## USP Development

### Requirements for Strong USP
1. **Relevant**: Customer must value it
2. **Unique**: Few or no competitors have it
3. **Provable**: You can back it up
4. **Clear**: Easy to understand

### If No USP Exists
Ask: "What is the market missing that customers value?"
Then: Engineer backward—what assets do you need to build?

## Positioning Types

### Vertical Positioning
Target specific industry/niche:
"CRM for real estate agents"
"Accounting software for freelancers"

**Pros**: Clear target, easier messaging, premium pricing
**Cons**: Smaller market, may outgrow

### Horizontal Positioning
Target based on use case across industries:
"Project management for remote teams"
"Analytics for product managers"

**Pros**: Larger market
**Cons**: Harder to target, more competition

## Messaging Framework

### Messaging vs. Positioning
- **Positioning**: Strategic—what makes you different
- **Messaging**: Tactical—how you communicate that difference

### Messaging Principles
1. **Clear & concise**: 1-3 key points max
2. **Customer-centric**: About them, not you
3. **Specific**: Concrete benefits, not vague claims
4. **Authentic**: Consistent tone of voice
5. **Emotional + logical**: Appeal to both
6. **Proof-backed**: Social proof, data, testimonials

### Message Architecture

**Headline**: Single most important benefit
**Subhead**: Supporting detail or proof
**Body**: Expand on value proposition
**Proof**: Social proof, testimonials, data
**CTA**: Clear next action

### Messaging by Buyer Journey Stage

| Stage | Focus | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Awareness | Problem recognition | "Tired of losing deals to poor follow-up?" |
| Consideration | Solution evaluation | "See how our AI-powered CRM tracks every touchpoint" |
| Decision | Why us | "Join 10,000 sales teams who closed 20% more deals" |

### Messaging by DMU Role (B2B)

| Role | Rational Benefit | Emotional Benefit |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| CEO | Faster growth | Pride in innovation |
| CMO | Better reporting | Look like a problem-solver |
| User | Saves time daily | Feel competent |
| IT | Easy integration | Fewer support tickets |
| Finance | Clear ROI | Trusted partner |
