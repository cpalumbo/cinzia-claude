# Market Frameworks

## Market-Problem Map

A tool for identifying the most pressing problems your customer faces that you can solve.

### Structure
Create a matrix with:
- **Rows**: 2-5 potential customer segments
- **Columns**: Problems your solution could solve
- **Inner cells**: How each segment describes the problem (in their words)

### Scoring (1-10 for each)
For each segment-problem intersection:
- **Pain Level**: How urgent/important is this problem? (bleeding pain = high score)
- **Ease of Sale**: Do you have access? Is sales cycle short/affordable?
- **Ease of Implementation**: How easy to deliver the solution for this segment?

### Process
1. List 2-5 segment candidates from initial research
2. List 3-5 problems your solution addresses
3. Fill inner cells with customer language (from interviews)
4. Score each intersection
5. Sum scores—highest = best beachhead candidate
