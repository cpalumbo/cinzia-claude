# Growth Frameworks

## Channel Selection: Bullseye Framework

### Three Rings
1. **Outer ring**: Brainstorm ALL possible channels
2. **Middle ring**: Top 6 worth testing
3. **Inner ring (Bullseye)**: 2-3 that actually drive results

### Channel Selection Criteria
- Customer research (where do they spend time?)
- Competitor analysis (what works for them?)
- Your strengths (what can you execute well?)
- Unit economics (CAC < LTV within timeline)
- Scalability (can it grow with you?)

## Demand Strategy

### Demand Capture
**Target**: Solution-aware prospects actively searching

**Channels**:
- SEM (Google Ads)
- Comparison sites (G2, Capterra)
- Retargeting
- Bottom-of-funnel content

**Best for**: Existing demand, faster results

### Demand Generation
**Target**: Problem-aware (or unaware) prospects

**Channels**:
- Content marketing
- Thought leadership
- Social media
- PR
- Events

**Best for**: New categories, long-term positioning

### Decision Guide
1. Is there existing demand? → Start with demand capture
2. No existing demand? → Is there adjacent demand to piggyback? → Demand capture there
3. No adjacent demand? → Demand generation

## Growth Loops

### What Are Growth Loops?
Closed systems where output becomes input for more output.
Unlike funnels (linear), loops compound over time.

### 5 Growth Loop Archetypes

#### 1. Usage-Based Loop
User uses product → creates shareable output → others see it → new users

**Example**: Loom
- Record video → share link → recipient watches → sees Loom branding → signs up

#### 2. User-Generated Content Loop
Users create content → content indexed/discovered → new users find it → create more content

**Example**: Google
- Creators make content → Google indexes → searchers find → more creators

#### 3. Collaboration Loop
User invites collaborator → collaborator experiences product → becomes user

**Example**: Figma
- Designer shares file → collaborator views/edits → signs up → shares with others

#### 4. Viral Loop
User has emotional experience → shares publicly → creates awareness → new users

**Example**: Spotify Wrapped
- Personalized recap → user shares on social → friends curious → sign up

#### 5. Distribution Loop
Product exposure through usage creates new user awareness

**Example**: Calendly
- User shares scheduling link → recipient sees Calendly → considers for own use

## Channel Economics

### Key Metrics

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**
Total acquisition spend / New customers acquired

Include: Ads, tools, labor, agency fees—not just ad spend

**LTV (Lifetime Value)**
Average revenue per customer × Average customer lifespan

**LTV:CAC Ratio**
- 1:1 = Breaking even (bad)
- 3:1 = Healthy SaaS benchmark
- 5:1 = Very efficient (or underinvesting)

**Payback Period**
Time to recover CAC from customer revenue

---

## Attribution

### Models
- **First touch**: Credit to first interaction
- **Last touch**: Credit to converting touchpoint
- **Linear**: Equal credit across all touches
- **Time decay**: More credit to recent touches
- **Position-based**: 40% first, 40% last, 20% middle

### Self-Reported Attribution
Ask customers: "How did you hear about us?"
Often more accurate than analytics for awareness channels

### Multi-Touch Reality
Most B2B journeys involve 20+ touchpoints.
Don't over-optimize for single-touch attribution.

## GTM Unit Economics Example

**SaaS Example**:
- Subscription: $99/month
- Average customer lifespan: 18 months
- LTV: $1,782
- Target CAC: $594 (3:1 ratio)

**PLG Funnel**:
- 1,000 visitors
- 9% sign up free: 90 users
- 30% activate: 27 activated
- 5% convert to paid: ~1-2 customers

If $2,000 ad spend → 1,400 clicks → ~2 customers
CAC = $1,000 (too high!)

**Options**:
- Improve conversion rates
- Lower CPC channels
- Increase pricing
- Extend customer lifetime
