# Early Customer Profile (ECP) Frameworks

## ECP vs. Persona

**Traditional Persona**: Fictional archetype ("John Smith, 37, Nashville, likes grilling")
**ECP**: Research-driven profile of early adopters who will buy in GTM phase

ECPs are different because:
- Focus on early adopters, not ideal long-term customers
- Based on empirical evidence, not imagination
- Constantly evolving with new insights
- Include validation plan, not just description

## OODA Loop for Customer Discovery

Military decision-making framework adapted for GTM.

### Observe
Validate the problem exists through:
- Customer interviews
- Behavior observation
- Data analysis
- Social listening

### Orient
Test if proposed solution resonates:
- Prototype feedback
- Landing page tests
- Surveys with target segment
- Pilot/beta programs

### Decide
Based on findings:
- Formulate specific hypotheses
- Choose validation methods
- Plan experiments

### Act
Execute validation:
- Minimum viable tests
- Iterate based on results
- Scale what works

## Assumption Mapping

Prioritize which assumptions to test first.

### Matrix Dimensions
- **Y-axis**: Known ↔ Unknown
- **X-axis**: Unimportant ↔ Important

### Quadrants
1. **Unknown + Important** = TEST FIRST (mission-critical unknowns)
2. **Known + Important** = Monitor and validate
3. **Unknown + Unimportant** = Test later or ignore
4. **Known + Unimportant** = Ignore

### Common GTM Assumptions to Test
- Problem exists and is painful enough
- Target segment is aware of the problem
- They're actively seeking solutions
- They're willing to pay [price]
- They can be reached via [channel]
- Decision maker is [role]
- Purchase timeline is [duration]
- Key objections are [list]

## ECP Validation Toolkit

### Method 1: Customer Discovery Interviews
**Goal**: Understand problems, not validate your solution

**Questions to ask**:
- Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]
- What did you do about it?
- What have you tried?
- What didn't work?
- What would the ideal solution look like?
- How much would you pay to make this problem go away?

**Don't ask**:
- Would you use our product?
- Do you like this feature?
- Would you pay $X for this?

**Sample size**: 10-20 interviews for initial patterns

### Method 2: Surveys
Best for:
- Validating patterns from interviews
- Quantifying preferences
- Reaching larger samples

**Tools**: Typeform, SurveyMonkey, Google Forms

**Best practices**:
- Keep short (<5 min)
- Use scales for quantitative data
- Include open-ended questions for insights
- Offer incentive if needed
- Target 100+ responses for statistical relevance

### Method 3: Landing Page Tests
Validate demand before building.

**Elements to test**:
- Value proposition headline
- Problem statement
- Target audience specificity
- Call-to-action (waitlist, pre-order)

**Metrics to track**:
- Conversion rate to signup
- Email quality (real vs. fake)
- Traffic source performance

### Method 4: Pilot Sales
Strongest validation—money as voting mechanism.

**Approaches**:
- Pre-orders
- Founding member pricing
- Beta access sales
- "Concierge MVP" (manual delivery)

### Method 5: Social Media Validation
- Post problem statements, measure engagement
- Run polls in relevant communities
- Analyze comments for language and pain points
- A/B test messaging in ads

### Job to Be Done
What are they trying to accomplish?
- Functional job: [e.g., "Reduce time spent on invoicing"]
- Emotional job: [e.g., "Feel in control of finances"]

### Problems and Pain Points

### Value Drivers
