# Scoring Framework

Systematic evaluation criteria for startup ideas.

## Multi-Factor Scoring Model

### Overview

Each idea is scored on 6 factors with different weights:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Market Size | 20% | TAM potential and growth trajectory |
| MVP Buildability | 15% | How quickly the team can ship v1 |
| Customer Acquisition | 20% | Clarity and feasibility of GTM |
| Market Momentum | 15% | Timing signals and tailwinds |
| Team Fit | 20% | Match with team strengths |
| Moat Potential | 10% | Defensibility over time |

## Factor 1: Market Size (20%)

### Scoring Rubric

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5** | TAM >$10B, SAM >$1B, clear path to $100M+ ARR. Market growing >20%/year. Multiple $1B+ exits in space. |
| **4** | TAM $1-10B, SAM $100M-1B, path to $50-100M ARR. Market growing 10-20%/year. Meaningful exits exist. |
| **3** | TAM $100M-1B, SAM $10-100M, path to $10-50M ARR. Market growing 5-10%/year. Some exits exist. |
| **2** | TAM $10-100M, unclear SAM, path to $1-10M ARR. Market flat or slow growth. Few exits. |
| **1** | TAM <$10M, niche market, lifestyle business potential only. Declining or stagnant market. |

### Key Questions

- How big is the total addressable market?
- What's the serviceable addressable market for your specific approach?
- Is the market growing, stable, or declining?
- What's the revenue potential at scale?
- Are there comparable exits that validate the market?

## Factor 2: MVP Buildability (15%)

### Scoring Rubric

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5** | Team can build functional MVP in <4 weeks. Core tech well-understood. No external dependencies. Existing tools/frameworks available. |
| **4** | MVP in 1-2 months. Minor technical challenges. Some new learning required. Minimal external dependencies. |
| **3** | MVP in 2-4 months. Moderate technical complexity. Requires learning new skills. Some external dependencies. |
| **2** | MVP in 4-6 months. Significant technical challenges. Requires hiring or expertise team lacks. Heavy dependencies. |
| **1** | MVP >6 months. Major technical unknowns. Requires research/breakthroughs. Hardware or regulatory complexity. |

### Key Questions

- Can the founders build a working version themselves?
- What's the minimum feature set for initial users?
- Are there technical unknowns or research required?
- What external dependencies exist (APIs, data, partnerships)?
- Has this type of product been built before?

## Factor 3: Customer Acquisition (20%)

### Scoring Rubric

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5** | Crystal clear ICP. Known channels to reach them. Founders have direct access to first 10 customers. Low CAC model (PLG, virality, community). |
| **4** | Clear ICP. Proven channels exist. Founders can reach first customers through network. Reasonable CAC expectations. |
| **3** | ICP defined but broad. Multiple channel options, unclear which works. Will need to experiment. Moderate CAC. |
| **2** | Vague ICP. No clear channel. Will require significant experimentation. High CAC likely. |
| **1** | Unknown customer. No idea how to reach them. Enterprise sales cycle with no network. Very high CAC. |

### Key Questions

- Who is the ideal customer profile (specific)?
- How will you reach your first 10 customers?
- What channels are proven for this customer type?
- What's the expected CAC and how does it compare to LTV?
- Is there potential for organic/viral growth?

## Factor 4: Market Momentum (15%)

### Scoring Rubric

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5** | Multiple "why now" signals. Recent tech enables solution. Regulatory tailwind. Behavior shift happening. Investor interest surging. Clear inflection point. |
| **4** | Strong "why now" story. 2-3 clear signals. Market clearly moving in favorable direction. Good timing evidence. |
| **3** | Reasonable "why now." Some signals present but not overwhelming. Market steady. Timing is okay, not exceptional. |
| **2** | Weak "why now." Could have been done years ago. No clear timing advantage. Market stable but not changing. |
| **1** | Bad timing. Market headwinds. Regulatory challenges. Technology not ready. Behavior going opposite direction. |

### Key Questions

- Why hasn't this been solved before?
- What changed to make this possible/urgent now?
- Are there technology, regulatory, or behavioral tailwinds?
- Is there momentum in funding/attention for this space?
- What's the cost of waiting vs. moving now?

## Factor 5: Team Fit (20%)

### Scoring Rubric

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5** | Exceptional fit. Deep domain expertise. Built similar products before. Direct customer access. Unique insight from experience. Passionate about problem. |
| **4** | Strong fit. Relevant experience in domain or technology. Good network. Motivated by problem. Some unique advantages. |
| **3** | Moderate fit. Transferable skills apply. Will need to learn domain. No special access but can develop. Interested in space. |
| **2** | Weak fit. Limited relevant experience. No domain knowledge. No customer access. Opportunity-driven, not passion-driven. |
| **1** | Poor fit. Wrong skills for the challenge. No relevant experience. Would need to hire for core competencies. No connection to problem. |

### Team Fit Sub-Scores

Rate each dimension and average:

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Technical capability for this MVP | /5 | |
| Domain expertise | /5 | |
| Customer access/network | /5 | |
| Relevant past experience | /5 | |
| Passion for the problem | /5 | |
| **Average Team Fit** | /5 | |

## Factor 6: Moat Potential (10%)

### Scoring Rubric

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5** | Multiple moat sources. Strong network effects. Proprietary data advantage. High switching costs. Brand potential. Technical barriers. |
| **4** | Clear moat path. One strong defensibility source. Reasonable barriers to competition. Can build advantages over time. |
| **3** | Moderate defensibility. Some barriers exist but not strong. First-mover advantage matters. Need to build moat deliberately. |
| **2** | Weak moat. Easily copyable. Low switching costs. Commoditizable. Competition on features/price likely. |
| **1** | No moat. Pure execution play. Anyone could build this. Race to bottom likely. |

### Moat Types to Evaluate

- **Network Effects**: Does value increase with more users?
- **Data Moat**: Does usage generate defensible data?
- **Switching Costs**: How hard is it to leave?
- **Brand/Trust**: Does reputation matter in this market?
- **Technical Barrier**: Is there unique IP or expertise required?
- **Regulatory**: Are there licenses or compliance barriers?
- **Scale Economies**: Does unit cost decrease with scale?

## Comparative Analysis

When evaluating multiple ideas, create comparison:

| Factor | Idea A | Idea B | Idea C |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Market Size | | | |
| MVP Buildability | | | |
| Customer Acquisition | | | |
| Market Momentum | | | |
| Team Fit | | | |
| Moat Potential | | | |
| **TOTAL** | | | |

### Decision Framework

1. **Clear winner**: One idea scores >0.5 higher than others → pursue it
2. **Close call**: Ideas within 0.5 → weight team passion more heavily
3. **All weak**: No idea scores >3.5 → continue research or pivot criteria
4. **Multiple strong**: Two ideas score >4.0 → validate both cheaply before committing
