# Idea Evaluation Checklist

Use this checklist to systematically evaluate startup ideas.

## The Three Criteria (Must-Haves)

### 1. Founder Desire
- [ ] Do the founders genuinely want this product to exist?
- [ ] Would they use it themselves?
- [ ] Is this solving their own problem, or are they guessing about others?

**Red flag:** "I can imagine other people wanting this" without personal urgency.

### 2. Founder Capability
- [ ] Can the founders build a working v1?
- [ ] Do they have relevant domain expertise?
- [ ] Can they iterate quickly without external dependencies?

**Red flag:** Requires hiring key talent before validation.

### 3. Non-Obvious Value
- [ ] Do few others recognize this opportunity?
- [ ] Is there a reason this hasn't been done well before?
- [ ] What insight do the founders have that others lack?

**Red flag:** Everyone agrees it's a good idea (likely high competition or already done).

## The Well Test

### Depth of Demand
- [ ] Is there intense need from a specific group?
- [ ] Would users be devastated if this disappeared?
- [ ] Are people hacking together workarounds today?

**Score:** 
- 🟢 "I would pay anything for this" — Strong signal
- 🟡 "That would be nice to have" — Weak signal
- 🔴 "I guess I'd try it" — No signal

### Narrowness (OK at Start)
- [ ] Is the initial target market well-defined?
- [ ] Can you name specific potential users?
- [ ] Is it narrow enough to dominate before expanding?

## Expansion Potential

### Path Out of the Well
- [ ] Is there a logical expansion path?
- [ ] Will the market grow as behavior/technology changes?
- [ ] Is this on the "leading edge" of a larger trend?

**Key question:** Is this idea a small problem, or a small *manifestation* of a big problem?

## Red Flag Detection

### Tarpit Ideas
- [ ] Have many others tried and failed at this?
- [ ] Is there something structurally hard that's not obvious?
- [ ] Does this require changing deeply ingrained behavior?

### Made-Up Ideas
- [ ] Did this come from "brainstorming startup ideas"?
- [ ] Does it sound impressive but feel hollow?
- [ ] Would the founder work on this even without funding?

### Schlep Disguise
- [ ] Is the idea actually good but dismissed as too hard?
- [ ] What would happen if you embraced the schlep?
- [ ] Is difficulty the moat?

## Competitive Landscape

### Existing Solutions
- [ ] What do people use today?
- [ ] Why hasn't this been solved well?
- [ ] What 10x improvement is possible?

### Defensibility
- [ ] Why won't big companies copy this?
- [ ] What unfair advantage does the founder have?
- [ ] Does solving this create a moat (data, network effects, switching costs)?

## Final Score

Rate each dimension 1-5:

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Founder desire | /5 | |
| Founder capability | /5 | |
| Non-obvious value | /5 | |
| Depth of demand | /5 | |
| Expansion potential | /5 | |
| Moat potential | /5 | |

**Minimum viable idea:** Score 4+ on first three dimensions, 3+ on others.
