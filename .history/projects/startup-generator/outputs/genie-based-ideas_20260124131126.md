  You built tooling for Julia, but your growth was capped by Julia's adoption — which wasn't your job to drive. This is a structural problem for
   any startup building on emerging technology.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                
  The painful insight: You can't just sell picks and shovels if no one's mining yet.

  The champions want the technology. The gatekeepers block it. The startup selling tooling is stuck in the middle with no leverage.

  - These three patterns are connected: emerging tech companies struggle to find real buyers because adoption is fragmented, champions are      
  isolated, and public signals are unreliable
