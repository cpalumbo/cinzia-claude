IMPRESSIVE

1. Vision and Mission
We aim to build the Impress of Preventive Healthcare: a vertically integrated network of preventive healthcare clinics, fully owned and operated by us. These clinics are designed from the ground up around early detection, prevention, and long-term health optimization, rather than reactive care.
Our core mission is to help people identify health risks earlier, gain a deeper understanding of their health, and take informed action before disease manifests. We do this through advanced diagnostics, continuous data, and personalized guidance.
Preventive healthcare today is fragmented, largely analog, and often superficial. Our goal is to make it systematic, data-rich, and genuinely useful.

2. Core Differentiation and Preventive Approach
Our differentiation comes from combining clinically rigorous preventive care with advanced diagnostics and a deeply integrated, end-to-end digital experience.
The physical clinics are a critical component of the model, but they are not the product on their own. They function as trusted, high-quality acquisition and care delivery points. The product is the end-to-end preventive healthcare system, delivered through a tightly coupled physical and digital experience.

2.1 Preventive Care Structured Around Core Risk Domains
All preventive care is organized around the four primary domains of chronic disease risk, often referred to as the Four Horsemen of preventive medicine, as described by Peter Attia:
Cardiovascular disease
Cancer
Metabolic disease
Neurodegenerative disease


This framework defines what we test, how results are interpreted, and how patients are monitored over time. It provides clinical rigor, prioritization, and a shared language across clinicians, the platform, and the customer experience.

2.2 Advanced and Novel Diagnostics Beyond Standard Healthcare
A core differentiator is access to advanced and novel diagnostics that are not typically available or not meaningfully integrated in standard healthcare clinics.
This includes:
Comprehensive blood testing
Extensive blood panels with 100+ biomarkers
Advanced cardiovascular risk markers such as ApoB and Lipoprotein(a)
Inflammatory, hormonal, metabolic, and nutritional markers
Early indicators of chronic disease risk that are usually not surfaced in routine care
Gut microbiome and functional testing
Advanced gut microbiome analysis
Metabolic flexibility testing
Stress and cortisol response
VO2 max and cardiovascular fitness
Body composition analysis, including muscle mass and bone density
Advanced imaging and screening
Preventive ultrasounds
MRI as a paid add-on when clinically appropriate
Confocal microscopy for non-invasive skin cancer prevention and early detection
The differentiation is not just access to these tests, but their integration into a coherent preventive model, rather than being offered as isolated services.

2.3 End-to-End Digital Experience as a Core Product
The digital experience is a core part of the product and a primary differentiator.
From the customer’s perspective, preventive care is delivered through a single, cohesive digital journey that spans the entire lifecycle:
Simple and intuitive booking, with clear explanations of what is being tested and why
Fast access to appointments and predictable turnaround times
Centralized access to all results through a well-designed web application
Clear visualization of results, trends, and risk signals over time
AI-assisted explanations that translate complex medical data into understandable insights
Clinician recommendations embedded directly into the digital experience
Clear distinction between informational insights, actionable recommendations, and monitoring
Automated reminders for follow-up testing, repeated exams, and preventive check-ins
The goal is to remove friction, ambiguity, and fragmentation from preventive healthcare, replacing them with clarity, continuity, and confidence.

2.4 AI- and Clinician-Guided Interpretation
Preventive diagnostics generate complex, high-dimensional data that is not usable without interpretation.
We combine AI-generated insights with clinician oversight to ensure recommendations are understandable, medically sound, and actionable.
AI is used to:
Synthesize multi-modal data across blood tests, microbiome data, imaging, and wearables
Detect patterns, trends, and early risk signals across time
Generate personalized guidance and preliminary recommendations


Clinicians:
Validate and contextualize AI outputs
Provide final recommendations and preventive plans
Decide when escalation, follow-up testing, or specialist referral is appropriate
This approach allows the system to scale while maintaining trust and medical accountability.

2.5 Continuous Data and Longitudinal Prevention
In addition to episodic testing, the platform integrates continuous health data from devices used by the customer, such as smartwatches and health tracking platforms.
This includes activity levels, heart rate and variability, sleep, stress, and, where available, glucose and nutrition data.
This continuous data is used to:
Contextualize diagnostic results
Detect early changes that may not yet be visible in periodic testing
Track the impact of lifestyle changes and interventions
Support personalized follow-up and prevention plans
By combining advanced diagnostics with continuous data and a strong digital layer, the system moves from isolated health snapshots to a longitudinal understanding of health and risk.

2.6 Clinics as Trust, Acquisition, and Data Infrastructure
Clinics serve as the physical foundation of the system:
They establish trust and clinical credibility
They enable high-quality data acquisition
They anchor long-term customer relationships


Over time, the digital platform becomes increasingly central, enabling value creation and engagement between visits and allowing the model to scale beyond the physical footprint of clinics.
This hybrid model enables the creation of a preventive healthcare platform that is defensible, scalable, and aligned with venture expectations, while remaining clinically serious.

3. Long-Term Relationship and Recurring Care
This is not a one-off testing business.
The model is designed for long-term engagement and recurring value through:
Scheduled follow-ups, such as every six or twelve months
Automated reminders for check-ups
Longitudinal health tracking that shows how health evolves over years
Personalized prevention plans that adapt over time
Subscription or membership models that encourage continuity
Health is treated as an ongoing process, not a single event.

4. Ownership of the Customer Experience
We intentionally own the customer experience end-to-end.
This means:
We own and operate the clinics 
We own the digital platform
We control the data model and user interface
We define the clinical protocols and operational standards
We do not rely on third-party clinics with inconsistent quality or misaligned incentives. Vertical integration is a deliberate choice to ensure quality, trust, and consistency.

5. Integration with Wearables and Health Data
We integrate with consumer health tracking devices and platforms to enable deeper personalization.
This includes:
Activity levels
Heart rate and heart rate variability
Sleep duration and sleep quality
Stress indicators
Potentially nutrition and glucose data, such as from continuous glucose monitors
This data is used to:
Contextualize lab and diagnostic results
Identify mismatches between subjective experience and objective signals
Generate more precise and personalized recommendations
Track the impact of lifestyle changes over time
The goal is to move from static health snapshots to continuous health understanding.


6. Target Customer
The initial target customer includes:
Health-conscious individuals 35y+
Professionals with disposable income
People already investing in fitness, nutrition, or wellness
Individuals dissatisfied with the reactivity and opacity of traditional healthcare
Over time, the platform can expand to:
Corporate preventive health programs
Family plans
Aging populations focused on healthy longevity



7. Product Principles
When making product and system decisions, we prioritize:
Clarity over completeness
Long-term trust over short-term monetization
Actionable insight over raw data
Prevention over treatment
Consistency and reliability over experimentation in clinical contexts
If a feature increases engagement but risks confusion or medical misinterpretation, it should be reconsidered.
