Our startup co-founding team 

Yerezhan, CPTO
https://www.linkedin.com/in/tashbenbetov/
Tech and product leader who builds real-world systems under real constraints - from mobile marketplaces to regulated healthcare and multi-country clinical operations.

Since 2020, he led both the engineering and product organization at Impress, Europe’s #1 chain of orthodontic clinics. I joined as CTO and founding engineer, and helped grow the company from the early stages into a global operation. My scope spans product strategy, architecture, and managing a 100+ person org across 9 countries and 200+ clinics.

I’ve helped build Impress’s full-stack patient and clinic platform - including custom EMRs, intelligent scheduling, AI-driven treatment planning, and internal tools. We’ve compressed costs while scaling access, launching tech that touches every part of the patient journey: ads, conversion, care, and retention.

Before Impress, I led teams at Yandex and Sberbank, shipping large-scale consumer platforms, analytics systems, and mobile apps - often under tight deadlines and complex constraints.

I like building things that work - especially when the domain is messy, the pressure is high, and the result improves real lives.

I joined Impress as the founding CTO and first technical leader, and have since scaled into the combined CTO & CPO role — overseeing all aspects of technology, product strategy, and platform development through hypergrowth, international expansion, and multiple funding rounds. My scope evolved from hands-on coding and system design to leading a 100+ person org across 9 countries and 200+ clinics.

Key accomplishments:

• Built the full-stack clinic and patient platform from scratch - covering EMRs, intelligent scheduling, treatment planning (TxP), and patient care tools
• Scaled product and engineering org from 0 to 100+ team members
• Led both product and tech leadership for ~3 years; hired every engineer, product and defined all core delivery systems
• Reduced treatment plan turnaround through AI-powered tooling
• Enabled international clinic expansion with unified infrastructure, compliance tooling, and cross-border patient access

Navigated growth through seed, Series A, and Series B (>€300M raised) — including M&As, pivots, and restructures.
