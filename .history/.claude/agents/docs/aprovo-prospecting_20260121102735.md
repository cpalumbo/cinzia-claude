Caution: Check their ToS for scraping, alternatively manually browse for top-rated clinics in each city:
Filter by specialty (implantología, ortodoncia)
50+ reviews = active, digitally engaged
Takes 2 hours to build a list of 50
Clinic Websites — Qualification signals
Services mentioned, booking system, WhatsApp, financing
