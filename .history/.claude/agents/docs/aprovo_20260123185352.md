Aprovo MVP (Minimal Viable Product) Definition

1) One‑liner
A focused WhatsApp + e‑signature + payments loop that accepts treatment quotes (presupuestos) and writes the information back into the clinic’s software - with a simple ROI dashboard.
2) Problem (today)
Clinics leak revenue when patients don’t accept presupuestos, miss recalls, or stall on payments/financing.


Existing “PRM” (patient messaging) tools are generic and don’t close the loop (no signature/payment in the same thread) or don’t write back to the clinic’s PMS (Practice Management System).


Staff spend time chasing patients and re‑typing statuses; leadership has no single view of ROI.


3) Product Idea (what to build)
A Spain‑first conversion platform that runs inside the channel patients read (WhatsApp) and completes the journey:
Nudge the patient with a pre‑approved WhatsApp template.


Mobile review of the presupuesto (clear benefits/co‑pay if known).


E‑signature to accept.


Payment: card or SEPA Direct Debit; (Bizum as an add‑on).


Write‑back to the clinic’s PMS: accepted / signed / booked (?) / paid.


ROI reporting: accepted € uplift, show‑rate improvement, minutes saved.


Not another PRM. This is a conversion tool: WA + e‑sign + pay + write‑back, with just enough reporting.
4) Why this wins (for clinics)
Immediate revenue impact: more accepted presupuestos, faster deposits, fewer no‑shows.


Less admin: no phone tag; statuses sync back to the PMS; fewer errors.


Patient‑friendly: everything happens on the phone, in WhatsApp, in minutes.


Compliance built‑in: consent, approved templates, eIDAS‑aligned signatures.


5) MVP Scope (v1)
Included
WhatsApp (WA): template catalog (ES), explicit opt‑in & one‑tap opt‑out, two‑way thread, reply capture.


E‑signature: embed SES/AES provider, timestamped audit trail; QES pathway prepared but used only for finance docs that need it.


Payments: cards + Klarna + SEPA Direct Debit (mandates stored); deposits and co‑pays from the phone. (Bizum on roadmap.)


PMS write‑back (v1): update key statuses (accepted/signed/booked/paid) via available hooks (API/Zapier/export‑import).


ROI dashboard (v1): funnel from presupuesto → signed → paid; weekly email report per clinic.


6) Core Flows (v1)
Treatment Acceptance Loop
 Presupuesto created → WA nudge → mobile view (benefits/co‑pay if known) → e‑sign (SES/AES) → payment (card/SEPA) → PMS write‑back → ROI dashboard.


Optional Recall Support (light)
 WA reminder → self‑rebook link (if PMS supports) → PMS write‑back → report on no‑show reduction. (Nice‑to‑have, but secondary to acceptance.)


7) Integrations (v1 → v2)
PMS/PVS (clinic software): start with the top systems used locally (e.g., Gesden One, Clinic Cloud, Nubimed) using exports/Zapier/API where available; deepen adapters post‑pilot.


E‑signature vendor: SES/AES embedded; QES capability for lender contracts.


Payments: Stripe for cards + SEPA Direct Debit; Bizum via bank/gateway (roadmap).


WhatsApp BSP (Business Solution Provider): template approval + delivery.


8) Compliance (baked in)
GDPR/LOPDGDD: explicit consent, opt‑out, data minimisation, retention policy, breach process, DPA with vendors.


WhatsApp policy: pre‑approved templates for outbound; log opt‑ins/opt‑outs and message purpose.


eIDAS signatures: SES/AES for treatment acceptance; QES only when required by finance partners.


Audit trail: who/what/when for messages, signatures, and payments.


9) Value / KPIs (how clinics judge us)
North Star: € uplift in accepted presupuestos within 30–60 days.


Supporting: % financed cases, no‑show reduction, minutes saved on follow‑ups or insurer packages, mobile payment adoption.


10) Ideal Customers (ICP)
Independents & small DSOs with 3–15 chairs, a meaningful share of insured/plan patients, and visible backlog of pending presupuestos. (more granular plan, who’s gonna use this?)


Early adopters who already use WhatsApp and are open to e‑sign & mobile payments.


11) Pricing (hypothesis)
Starter (independents): €199/mo + usage (WA/e‑sign).


Growth (multi‑chair): €399/mo + usage; PMS write‑back + analytics.


DSO: €699/site/mo (+ onboarding); optional portal‑ops add‑on (per pre‑auth package or SLA).


12) Roadmap (after MVP)
Bizum for Spain; MB Way/Multibanco (Portugal); BANCOMAT Pay / Satispay (Italy).


AI agents (supervised): Acceptance Agent, Recall Concierge, Front‑Desk Copilot (template‑bound, human‑in‑the‑loop).


Insurer “portal‑ops”: document bundling, queue tracking; optional RPA submit with human‑confirm.


Deeper PMS adapters: schedules, payments reconciliation, richer analytics.


13) Risks & Mitigations
Looks like generic PRM → Lead with conversion KPI; show PMS screenshots of accepted/signed/paid.


PMS friction → Start with export/Zapier; secure partner terms; prioritize 2–3 adapters.


WhatsApp policy/consent → Template governance; explicit opt‑in; audit logs.


Portal volatility (insurers) → Human‑in‑loop RPA; CSV/PDF fallback; clear SLAs.


Payments disputes → Clear receipt flows; SEPA mandates stored; refund policies.





14) Pilot Plan (4–6 weeks, no heavy engineering)
Sign 10 paid pilots (clinics with ≥40% insured share).


Run acceptance loop with SES/AES + card/SEPA; basic PMS write‑back.


Measure: accepted € uplift; % mobile deposits; time‑to‑signature; staff minutes saved. (goRoger claims 25% uplift)


Decide: scale adapters + Bizum after ≥15–25% uplift at 6+ sites.
